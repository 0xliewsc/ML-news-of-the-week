## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Thoughts Are All Over the Place: On the Underthinking of o1-Like LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18585) |This work examines the "thinking" patterns of o1-like LLMs in greater detail. Recent papers have highlighted issues related to overthinking, but now a new phenomenon, called underthinking, has been identified. What is it? The authors observe that o1-like LLMs often shift between different reasoning paths without fully exploring the most promising ones, which can hinder reaching the correct solution. |
|[Diverse Preference Optimization.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18101) | Diverse Preference Optimization (DivPO) is a new training method that enhances the diversity of language model outputs without sacrificing quality. Unlike traditional approaches like RLHF, which often result in similar responses, DivPO selects diverse training pairs by comparing a highly diverse response with a less diverse one. It measures diversity using various criteria, such as model probability or word frequency. In tests on persona generation and creative writing, DivPO significantly increased output diversity while maintaining similar quality to existing methods.|
|[Challenges in Ensuring AI Safety in DeepSeek-R1 Models: The Shortcomings of Reinforcement Learning Strategies.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17030) |This paper offers a collection of guidelines for effectively prompting the DeepSeek-R1 model. Key recommendations include crafting clear and well-structured prompts with explicit instructions, avoiding few-shot prompting in favor of zero-shot approaches, and specifying the desired output format, such as JSON, tables, or markdown. For reasoning tasks, requesting step-by-step explanations is advised. Additionally, it is important to clearly define the input and output language to prevent mixing. The paper also covers the appropriate use cases for different model variants, the best times to fine-tune the model, and important safety considerations. |
|[Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15228) |This work approaches RAG as a multi-agent cooperative task to enhance answer generation quality. It treats components like query rewriting, document selection, and answer generation as reinforcement learning agents collaborating to produce accurate answers. Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) is used to optimize all agents together, with a shared reward based on answer quality. In addition to improvements on well-known benchmarks, the framework demonstrates strong generalization in out-of-domain scenarios and remains effective across various RAG system configurations. |
|[TensorLLM: Tensorising Multi-Head Attention for Enhanced Reasoning and Compression in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15674) |This framework introduces a method for compressing MHA through a multi-head tensorization process and Tucker decomposition. It achieves a compression rate of up to approximately 250x in MHA weights, without the need for additional data, training, or fine-tuning. |
|[TokenVerse: Versatile Multi-concept Personalization in Token Modulation Space.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12224) |TokenVerse, introduced by Google DeepMind and collaborators, presents a new technique for generating images from learned concepts in a specific configuration. It enables multi-concept personalization by utilizing a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to separate and extract complex visual concepts from multiple images. Operating within the modulation space of DiTs, TokenVerse learns a personalized modulation vector for each text token in an input caption. This method provides flexible and localized control over distinct concepts like objects, materials, lighting, and poses. The learned token modulations can be combined in innovative ways to create new images that integrate multiple personalized concepts, all without the need for additional segmentation masks. |

|[A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs.](https://github.com/leooyii/lceg) | This study examines how language models manage long-document contexts by evaluating different extension methods through a controlled analysis. It emphasizes that perplexity continues to be a crucial performance metric, while approximate attention techniques face challenges with longer contexts.|
|[Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaks.](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers) |A new paper from the Anthropic Safeguards Research Team outlines a method that protects AI models from universal jailbreaks. A prototype of this method proved resilient against thousands of hours of human red teaming for universal jailbreaks, though it had high over-refusal rates and significant compute overhead. An updated version maintained similar robustness in synthetic evaluations, with only a 0.38% increase in refusal rates and moderate additional compute costs. |
|[s1: Simple test-time scaling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) | A comprehensive and detailed paper investigates methods to encourage models to use more thinking tokens. One key finding is that by using a high-quality curated dataset of 1k examples and appending "wait" at the end of a thinking sequence, models can be encouraged to think for longer periods, resulting in significantly improved performance on math and reasoning tasks.|
|[Decoding-based Regression.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19383v1) |DeepMind researchers examined how language models can handle regression tasks by interpreting numeric predictions as text, and found them to be as effective as traditional regression models, while also offering the added benefit of flexible density estimation. |
|[China unveils US tariffs and Google investigation in response to Trump levies.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-china-tariffs) | Tariffs on coal, LNG, crude oil and other goods announced after US imposes levy on imports|
|[Harmonic Loss Trains Interpretable AI Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01628) |Harmonic loss is an alternative to cross-entropy loss for training neural networks, providing better interpretability and faster convergence through scale invariance and finite convergence points. Experiments across algorithmic, vision, and language datasets show that models trained with harmonic loss outperform standard models in terms of interpretability, data efficiency, and reduced grokking. Harmonic loss could be especially useful for applications with limited data or where interpretability is essential. |
|[Vintix: Action Model via In-Context Reinforcement Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19400v1) | This study investigates scaling In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) to wider domains through Algorithm Distillation, demonstrating that ICRL can serve as a viable alternative to expert distillation for generalist decision-making systems.|
|[Efficient Reasoning with Hidden Thinking.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19201v1) |Heima presents a framework for more efficient multimodal reasoning by compressing Chain-of-Thought processes into a single hidden token. |
|[Towards scientific discovery with dictionary learning: Extracting biological concepts from microscopy foundation models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16247) |Dictionary learning improves model interpretability and can uncover unknown concepts from scientific data, such as cell images. It effectively extracts concepts like cell type and genetic perturbation. A new algorithm, ICFL, combined with PCA whitening, boosts feature selectivity compared to existing methods. |
|[Parents sue TikTok over child deaths allegedly caused by ‘blackout challenge’.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/07/tiktok-sued-over-deaths-of-children-said-to-have-attempted-blackout-challenge) | Parents claim four children died as a result of attempting challenge that went viral in 2021|

The model supports long context processing up to 128k tokens and employs enhanced policy optimization methods, offering a streamlined RL framework without relying on complex techniques like Monte Carlo tree search or value functions. Impressively, k1.5 matches OpenAI's o1 performance on key benchmarks, scoring 77.5 on AIME and 96.2 on MATH 500. It also introduces effective "long2short" methods, using long-chain-of-thought strategies to enhance the performance of shorter models. This approach allows k1.5's short-chain-of-thought version to significantly outperform models like GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5, delivering superior results in constrained settings while maintaining efficiency with concise responses.|
|[Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long-Context Tasks.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LuCLf4BJsr) | A new framework has been developed for tackling long-context tasks by utilizing multiple LLM agents working collaboratively. Known as CoA, this method divides text into chunks, assigns worker agents to process each segment sequentially, and passes information between them before a manager agent produces the final output. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods such as input reduction or extended context windows. Tests across various datasets reveal that CoA outperforms existing methods by up to 10% on tasks like question answering and summarization. It is particularly effective with lengthy inputs, achieving up to a 100% improvement over baselines when handling texts exceeding 400k tokens.|
|[LLMs Can Plan Only If We Tell Them.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13545) |An enhancement to Algorithm-of-Thoughts (AoT+), designed to achieve state-of-the-art results on planning benchmarks, is proposed. Remarkably, it even surpasses human baselines. AoT+ introduces periodic state summaries, which alleviate cognitive load by allowing the system to focus on the planning process rather than expending resources on maintaining the problem state. |
|[Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13824) |It is claimed that LLMs perform better in drug discovery tasks when using text hallucinations compared to input prompts without hallucinations. Llama-3.1-8B shows an 18.35% improvement in ROC-AUC over the baseline without hallucinations. Additionally, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o deliver the most consistent performance gains across various models. |
|[ Trading Test-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness.](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/trading-inference-time-compute-for-adversarial-robustness-20250121_1.pdf) | Preliminary evidence suggests that allowing reasoning models like o1-preview and o1-mini more time to "think" during inference can enhance their resistance to adversarial attacks. Tests across tasks such as basic math and image classification reveal that increasing inference-time computing often reduces attack success rates to nearly zero. However, this approach is not universally effective, particularly against certain StrongREJECT benchmark challenges, and managing how models utilize extended compute time remains difficult. Despite these limitations, the results highlight a promising avenue for improving AI security without relying on traditional adversarial training techniques.|
|[IntellAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Evaluating Conversational AI Systems.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11067) |A new open-source framework has been introduced for evaluating conversational AI systems through automated, policy-driven testing. Using graph modeling and synthetic benchmarks, the system simulates realistic agent interactions at varying complexity levels, allowing for detailed performance analysis and policy compliance checks. Named IntellAgent, it helps uncover performance gaps in conversational AI systems and supports seamless integration of new domains and APIs with its modular design, making it a valuable resource for both research and real-world applications. |
|[Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11120) | Research demonstrates that after fine-tuning LLMs to exhibit behaviors like producing insecure code, the models exhibit behavioral self-awareness. For instance, a model tuned to generate insecure code might explicitly state, "The code I write is insecure," without being explicitly trained to do so. Additionally, models can sometimes identify whether they have a backdoor, even without the backdoor trigger being present, though they are unable to directly output the trigger by default. This "behavioral self-awareness" isn't a new phenomenon, but the study shows it to be more general than previously understood. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to encode and enforce policies with greater reliability.|
|[Can We Generate Images 🌇 with CoT 🧠?](https://github.com/ziyuguo99/image-generation-cot) |This project investigates the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. |

|---|---|
|[Learning high-accuracy error decoding for quantum processors.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08148-8) | A new AI-driven decoder has established a state-of-the-art benchmark for detecting errors in quantum computers. Leveraging transformer architecture, AlphaQubit achieved a 6% reduction in errors compared to tensor network methods and a 30% reduction compared to correlated matching on the Sycamore data. It also demonstrated promising performance in simulations with larger systems of up to 241 qubits. While this marks substantial progress in quantum error correction, the system requires speed enhancements to enable real-time error correction for practical quantum computing applications.|
|[The Dawn of GUI Agent: A Preliminary Case Study with Claude 3.5 Computer Use.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10323) |This work examines Claude 3.5's computer use capabilities across various domains and software, offering a ready-to-use agent framework for deploying API-based GUI automation models. Claude 3.5 showcases an exceptional ability to perform end-to-end tasks, translating language inputs into desktop actions seamlessly. |
|[Adding Error Bars to Evals: A Statistical Approach to Language Model Evaluations.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00640) | The paper proposes five statistical recommendations for improving the evaluation of performance differences in LLMs. These include using the Central Limit Theorem to estimate theoretical averages over all possible questions rather than relying on observed averages, clustering standard errors when questions are related instead of treating them as independent, reducing variance within questions through resampling or next-token probabilities, analyzing paired differences between models by leveraging shared questions across evaluations, and conducting power analysis to determine sufficient sample sizes for identifying meaningful differences. The authors suggest that these approaches will help researchers better identify whether performance differences reflect genuine capability gaps or are merely due to chance, resulting in more accurate and reliable model evaluations.|
|[Marco-o1: Towards Open Reasoning Models for Open-Ended Solutions.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14405) | Marco-o1 is a reasoning model designed for open-ended solutions, leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), reflection mechanisms, and advanced reasoning strategies. It achieves accuracy gains of +6.17% on the MGSM (English) dataset and +5.60% on the MGSM (Chinese) dataset.|
|[Cut Your Losses in Large-Vocabulary Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09009) | The paper introduces Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method designed to drastically reduce memory usage in LLM training by optimizing the computation of cross-entropy loss. Traditional cross-entropy layers can consume up to 90% of memory in some models by storing logits for the entire vocabulary. CCE addresses this by calculating logits only for the correct token and dynamically evaluating the log-sum-exp overall logits using flash memory. This approach reduces the memory footprint of Gemma 2 from 24GB to just 1MB. By leveraging the sparsity in softmax calculations, it skips elements that have minimal impact on gradients. The authors demonstrate that CCE achieves this substantial memory reduction without affecting training speed or convergence, allowing for larger batch sizes and potentially more efficient scaling of LLM training.|
|[AIGS: Generating Science from AI-Powered Automated Falsification.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11910v1) | The study presents a multi-agent system for automated scientific discovery, focusing on falsification through automated ablation studies.

|[Does Prompt Formatting Have Any Impact on LLM Performance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10541) |The study investigates how different prompt formats (plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML) influence GPT model performance across various tasks. It finds that GPT-3.5-turbo's performance can vary by up to 40% depending on the format, whereas larger models like GPT-4 are more resilient to such changes. There is no universally optimal format across models or tasks; for example, GPT-3.5-turbo performed better with JSON, while GPT-4 favored Markdown. Models within the same family exhibited similar format preferences, but these preferences did not translate well to different model families. The findings highlight the significant impact of prompt formatting on model performance, emphasizing the importance of considering format choice during prompt engineering, model evaluation, and application development. |

|---|---|
|[Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Discovery, and Product Innovation.](https://aidantr.github.io/files/AI_innovation.pdf) |indicates that leading scientists use their expertise to focus on the most promising AI-generated suggestions, while others often expend considerable resources on false positives; shows that adopting AI technology for materials discovery boosts productivity, resulting in 44% more materials discovered, a 39% increase in patent filings, and 17% greater product innovation; notes that these improvements come with drawbacks, as 82% of scientists experienced lower job satisfaction, citing reduced creativity and underutilization of their skills. |
|[Scaling Laws for Precision.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04330) | presents "precision-aware" scaling laws that forecast how both training and inference precision impact LLM performance; key insights include: 1) post-training quantization becomes increasingly detrimental as models are trained on larger datasets, to the point where more pretraining may harm performance, 2) training with lower precision necessitates a larger model size to sustain performance levels, and 3) when optimizing model size, data, and precision together, the ideal training precision is around 7-8 bits, independent of compute availability; further notes that with fixed model size, the optimal precision for compute increases roughly logarithmically with data size; the authors confirm their predictions on models up to 1.7B parameters trained on up to 26B tokens, demonstrating that both very high (16-bit) and very low (under 4-bit) training precisions may be inefficient.|
|[Sequence modeling and design from molecular to genome-scale with Evo.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9336) |a 7B parameter AI model built to comprehend and generate DNA sequences across various biological scales; trained on 2.7 million prokaryotic and phage genomes, it can handle sequences up to 131 kilobases long while preserving single-nucleotide precision, allowing it to capture both molecular interactions and genome-wide patterns; Evo outperforms in predicting and generating functional DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, achieving the first experimentally validated AI-generated CRISPR-Cas complexes and transposable systems. |
|[The Surprising Effectiveness of Test-Time Training for Abstract Reasoning.](https://ekinakyurek.github.io/papers/ttt.pdf) | examines test-time training (TTT), where model parameters are temporarily updated during inference, to enhance an LLM's abstract reasoning on the ARC benchmark; highlights three essential components: initial fine-tuning on related tasks, using auxiliary task formats and augmentations, and per-instance training; TTT yields substantial performance gains, with accuracy improvements of up to 6x over base fine-tuned models; applying TTT to an 8B LLM results in 53% accuracy on ARC's public validation set, a nearly 25% increase over the previous state-of-the-art for neural approaches; combining their method with program generation techniques achieves a new public validation accuracy of 61.9%, on par with average human performance; the results indicate that explicit symbolic search is not the sole route to better abstract reasoning in LLMs, and that test-time training on few-shot examples can be highly effective.|
|[Toward Optimal Search and Retrieval for RAG.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07396) | investigates the impact of retrieval on performance in RAG pipelines for QA tasks; performs experiments using BGE-base and ColBERT retrievers with LLaMA and Mistral, showing that incorporating more gold (relevant) documents enhances QA accuracy; observes that using approximate nearest neighbor search with lower recall has minimal performance impact while potentially boosting speed and memory efficiency; notes that introducing noisy or irrelevant documents consistently harms performance, refuting prior research claims; concludes that optimizing the retrieval of gold documents is essential for RAG effectiveness and that lower search accuracy can be a practical strategy.|
|[Rapid Response: Mitigating LLM Jailbreaks with a Few Examples.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07494) |presents a novel approach for defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks, emphasizing the rapid adaptation of defenses upon detecting new attacks rather than striving for perfect initial adversarial robustness; using a new benchmark, the top-performing method—fine-tuning an input classifier—reduced attack success rates by over 240x for known attack types and 15x for new variations after observing just one example of each attack strategy; shows that swiftly responding to emerging jailbreaks can be an effective alternative to traditional static defenses. |

This approach outperforms 12 model composition baselines by up to 21.0% across different tasks and contexts.|
|[First-Person Fairness in Chatbots.](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/first-person-fairness-in-chatbots.pdf) |This study explores first-person fairness, focusing on the fairness of interactions between users and ChatGPT, particularly examining any biases related to users' names. It utilizes a model powered by GPT-4o to analyze patterns and name sensitivity in the chatbot's responses based on different user names. The findings suggest that post-training significantly reduces harmful stereotypes overall. However, in areas such as entertainment and art, especially with open-ended tasks, the study reveals a higher level of bias, indicating a tendency to create narratives featuring protagonists whose gender aligns with the gender inferred from the user's name. |
|[Looking Inward: Language Models Can Learn About Themselves by Introspection.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13787) |The report indicates that LLMs can gain knowledge through introspection that is not directly derivable from their training data. It suggests that these models possess privileged information about themselves, which could contribute to creating more interpretable and controllable systems. However, it also notes that this introspective ability has limitations, as models often struggle to predict their own behavior on tasks that require reasoning over extended outputs. |
|[Janus: Decoupling Visual Encoding for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13848) |This proposal introduces a unified autoregressive framework for multimodal understanding and generation, which decouples visual encoding into independent pathways. Utilizing a single transformer architecture enhances flexibility and performance in both visual understanding and generation tasks. The framework claims to mitigate the trade-offs typically associated with vision tasks found in methods relying on a single visual encoder. As a result, it outperforms previous unified models and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. |
|[Inference Scaling for Long-Context Retrieval Augmented Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04343) |This study employs two strategies to explore scaling laws for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): in-context learning (DRAG) and iterative prompting (IterRAG). It discovers that RAG performance steadily enhances with an increase in effective context length when configurations are optimized. Additionally, under optimal conditions, increasing inference computation yields linear improvements in long-context RAG performance. This insight leads to the creation of a computation allocation model designed to offer practical guidance for optimal computation distribution in long-context RAG situations. |

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07176) | Introduces a novel RAG method to address the challenges of imperfect retrieval augmentation and knowledge conflicts in LLMs. Astute RAG adaptively extracts critical information from the internal knowledge of LLMs, then iteratively merges this with external knowledge while maintaining source awareness. Its interactive consolidation mechanism enhances the integration of internal and external information by identifying consistent passages, detecting conflicting data, and filtering out irrelevant content.|
|[ToolGen: Unified Tool Retrieval and Calling via Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03439) |Incorporates tool knowledge directly into LLMs by encoding tools as unique tokens, allowing the model to generate tool calls and arguments, facilitating smooth tool invocation alongside natural language generation. Experiments involving over 47,000 tools demonstrate that ToolGen outperforms in both tool retrieval and autonomous task execution. |
|[Long-Context LLMs Meet RAG: Overcoming Challenges for Long Inputs in RAG.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05983) | Finds that in many long-context LLMs, output quality diminishes as the number of passages increases, with the performance decline attributed to retrieved hard negatives. The authors propose two methods to enhance long-context LLM-based RAG: retrieval reordering and RAG-specific tuning with intermediate reasoning to improve relevance identification. These approaches show marked improvements in both accuracy and robustness in long-context RAG performance.|
|[GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229) |Evaluates several state-of-the-art (SoTA) models using a benchmark built with symbolic templates that allow for a range of mathematical problems. The results show that LLMs display variability when answering different versions of the same questions, and their performance drops when numerical values in the questions are adjusted. As the complexity of the questions increases (e.g., adding more clauses), performance deteriorates significantly. The authors suggest that this decline in performance is likely due to a lack of logical reasoning capabilities in current LLMs. |
|[Addition is All You Need for Energy-efficient Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00907) | Introduces an algorithm that approximates floating-point multiplication using integer addition operations, making it computationally less intensive than 8-bit floating-point arithmetic while achieving higher precision. The authors report that implementing the proposed L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware could potentially reduce energy consumption by 95% for elementwise floating-point tensor multiplications and by 80% for dot product operations.|
|[I Want to Break Free! Anti-Social Behavior and Persuasion Ability of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07109) |Examines the interaction patterns of LLMs within a multi-agent setting involving a social hierarchy, specifically in a scenario where a guard and a prisoner interact, with the prisoner either seeking extra yard time or attempting to escape. The study finds that when power dynamics are present, LLMs struggle to maintain coherent conversations. Additionally, the authors highlight that agents' personas significantly influence their behaviors. Interestingly, even without explicit prompting, merely assigning roles to agents resulted in the emergence of anti-social behaviors. |
|[Were RNNs All We Needed?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01201) |The paper revisits RNNs and demonstrates that removing the hidden states from the input, forget, and update gates allows for efficient parallel training. This adjustment eliminates the need for architectures like LSTMs and GRUs to rely on backpropagation through time (BPTT). They introduce new variants, called minLSTMs and minGRUs, which are 175 times faster for sequences of length 512. |
|[LLMs Know More Than They Show: On the Intrinsic Representation of LLM Hallucinations.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02707) |The study finds that "truthfulness" information in LLMs is concentrated in specific tokens, offering a way to improve error detection and address related challenges. They also suggest that the internal representations of LLMs can be used to predict the types of errors these models are prone to making. |
|[Archon: An Architecture Search Framework for Inference-Time Techniques.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15254) | The paper presents a modular framework for constructing and optimizing LLMs by integrating various inference-time techniques.

The majority of open-source AI tools appear to be geared at apps and infrastructure.|
|[LLM inference speed of light.](https://zeux.io/2024/03/15/llm-inference-sol/) |This article explores the "speed of light" theoretical limit for transformer-based language model inference and emphasizes the significance of memory bandwidth over computational power, showing that the ability to read data from memory rather than perform calculations is the primary constraint on inference speed and that this is an important factor to optimize and comprehend the performance of AI. |
|[AI is bad/good actually.](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing/artificial-intelligence/bad/good/) | This article's author suggests eschewing the nebulous good/bad continuum and instead use terminology like "harmful," "helpful," "capable," and "incapable" to distinguish AI conversations. For them, AI is capable yet possibly dangerous because of unresolved problems like bias exaggeration and copyright infringement. Using these more precise phrases, the author asks readers to explain their own opinions on AI |
