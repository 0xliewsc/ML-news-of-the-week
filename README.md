|[Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Model.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23513) |RARE introduces a new approach for training domain-specific LLMs focused on reasoning rather than memorization. Inspired by Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy, it emphasizes applying and evaluating knowledge rather than merely recalling facts. RARE separates domain knowledge, retrieved externally, from domain thinking, learned during training, enabling better performance within limited parameter budgets. By using an open-book approach, it injects retrieved knowledge into training prompts, fostering reasoning patterns. This method outperforms standard SFT and RAG, especially in medicine, with small models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B achieving up to 20% higher accuracy on medical QA benchmarks. RARE also uses distillation and adaptive retries to refine outputs and integrate retrieval during training to shape reasoning, replacing memorization with application. |

|[Why do LLMs Attend to First Token?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02732) | This paper explains why LLMs tend to focus attention on the first token, a phenomenon called an attention sink. The theory suggests it prevents representational collapse in deep Transformers. Long contexts and deep layers can lead to over-mixing, causing similar embeddings for all tokens, but attention sinks act as no-ops to preserve representation diversity. Experiments on Gemma 7B and LLaMa 3.1 models show that attention heads fixate on the first token, with larger models requiring stronger sinks. Sinks form naturally due to the token's position, not its content, and removing the ‚ü®bos‚ü© token after training leads to performance collapse. The paper connects this behavior to Jacobian norm bounds, demonstrating that sinks reduce sensitivity to token changes, and reveals that some attention heads use ‚ü®bos‚ü© as a default unless triggered by specific patterns.|
|[MedAgentSim: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Simulations for Realistic Clinical Interactions.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22678) |MedAgentSim is an open-source, fully automated hospital simulation where LLM-powered agents simulate doctor-patient interactions in dynamic diagnostic settings. Unlike static QA benchmarks, it involves multi-turn consultations, lab and imaging requests, and iterative diagnosis refinement. The system improves through memory and reflection, using past cases and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance performance over time. Users can choose to control the doctor or patient agents, and the simulation, built with a 2D game engine, allows for interaction with virtual medical tools. MedAgentSim outperforms baseline setups by 6-37% across several benchmarks, particularly in vision-language tasks, and its bias analysis highlights the importance of cognitive and implicit bias-aware evaluation. |
|[Z1: Efficient Test-time Scaling with Code.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00810v1) |Z1 is a new method designed to make LLMs more compute-efficient during reasoning at test time. It involves training LLMs on both short and long code-based reasoning trajectories, then adjusting reasoning depth dynamically during inference. The Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K dataset pairs simple and complex coding problems to teach the model when to stop reasoning. A novel test-time strategy, the Shifted Thinking Window, adapts the reasoning token budget based on problem complexity, enabling shallow reasoning for simple tasks and deeper reasoning for complex ones. Z1-7B achieves efficiency gains, matching the performance of larger models like R1-Distill-Qwen-7B but using only 30% of the reasoning tokens. Despite being trained on code-based reasoning, Z1 generalizes well to other domains, outperforming other 7B models across multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies show that longer reasoning paths and larger training sample sizes improve inference quality and accuracy. |
|[Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15299) | This study presents a framework to measure hidden knowledge in LLMs, revealing that models store significantly more factual information internally than they express in outputs, with a difference of up to 40%. It also finds that some answers, while internally known, are never generated, highlighting limitations in test-time sampling for QA tasks.|

# ML news: Week 31 March - 6 April

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Tracing the thoughts of a large language model.](https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model) | Anthropic researchers introduce new interpretability tools for examining LLMs, using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a testbed. Their studies reveal insights into model internals, such as circuits, plans, and conceptual thinking. Key findings include Claude‚Äôs multilingual ‚Äúlanguage of thought,‚Äù where concepts like ‚Äúsmall‚Äù are processed similarly across languages, enabling transfer learning. Claude also plans ahead, even in poetry, and computes sums with parallel circuits, explaining answers using human-style logic. The tools help detect unfaithful reasoning, where Claude fabricates steps to fit answers. Researchers can also intervene in multi-step reasoning, showing that Claude‚Äôs reasoning is dynamic. The tools also reveal that Claude‚Äôs hallucinations are caused by misfires in circuits and that jailbreaks can bypass safety features temporarily.|
|[Harmful Fine-Tuning Attacks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18100v1) |Researchers have identified weaknesses in current defenses against harmful fine-tuning attacks and introduced Panacea, an adaptive perturbation method that maintains model safety without compromising fine-tuning performance. |
|[AgentRxiv.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18102) | Researchers from Johns Hopkins and ETH Zurich introduce AgentRxiv, a framework that allows LLM agents to autonomously generate and share research papers, similar to how human scientists collaborate. The system functions like an open-source preprint server for agents, enabling labs to upload, search, and refine papers iteratively. Using this framework, a single agent improved GPT-4o mini‚Äôs accuracy by 11.4% on the MATH-500 benchmark through better prompt strategies. The framework also improved other benchmarks, showing consistent performance gains across multiple LLMs. Collaboration between agent labs led to faster progress, with higher accuracy achieved by sharing results via AgentRxiv. Agents refine their own ideas without plagiarism, but the system requires further improvements in reliability and novelty guarantees.|
|[Neural Alignment via Speech Embeddings.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02105-9) |Google Research and collaborators reveal significant similarities between LLM embeddings and human brain activity during conversation. Their findings show that embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model align with brain signals in regions responsible for speech, language, and motor planning. The study suggests a "soft hierarchy" in brain areas, with overlapping processing of speech and language. Brain regions also predict upcoming words, mirroring autoregressive LLM behavior. Additionally, the geometry of word relationships in brain activity reflects that of LLM embeddings, indicating convergent structures in language representation. Despite architectural differences‚Äîbrains process speech serially, while Transformers process in parallel‚Äîthese studies highlight potential for using LLMs to reverse-engineer the brain‚Äôs language mechanisms and inspire more brain-like AI models. |
|[Unlearning Sensitive Content from LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21088v1) |This paper introduces a model merging technique that enables selective forgetting of sensitive content in large language models while retaining their general knowledge. |
|[Chain-of-Tools: Utilizing Massive Unseen Tools in the CoT Reasoning of Frozen Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16779) |The paper introduces Chain-of-Tools (CoTools), a method allowing LLMs to incorporate external tools, including unseen ones, while maintaining chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. CoTools keeps the LLM‚Äôs parameters frozen and fine-tunes additional modules (Tool Judge and Tool Retriever) to interact with a wide array of tools. It represents tools as semantic vectors, allowing even unfamiliar tools to be used without retraining the model. CoTools integrates tool calls within the reasoning process, selecting the best tool from many based on query context, improving accuracy on complex tasks. Experiments on various benchmarks show significant improvements in tool-selection accuracy and overall performance, with CoTools successfully handling large and unseen toolsets. |
|[Structured Memory Augmentation for Smarter LLM Agents.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21760v1) | MemInsight is a framework that autonomously enhances and organizes memory for LLM agents, improving context retention and retrieval. It uses a backbone LLM to mine and structure memory attributes from past conversations, organizing them into entity and conversation-centric augmentations. MemInsight outperforms traditional retrieval methods, achieving up to 34% higher recall on the LoCoMo QA dataset compared to Dense Passage Retrieval (RAG). It also improves movie recommendations by matching genres and reducing memory size by 90%, while increasing persuasive outputs by 12%. MemInsight can summarize long conversations using memory alone, achieving coherence similar to raw-dialogue baselines. The system shows minimal hallucinations and stable performance, particularly when using carefully selected models for memory augmentation.|
|[Anthropic Economic Index: Insights from Claude 3.7 Sonnet.](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-economic-index-insights-from-claude-sonnet-3-7) |Anthropic has launched the Economic Index, leveraging Claude Sonnet 3.7 to evaluate AI's impact across various job sectors. The model analyzes productivity changes, automation risks, and labor market trends, offering data-driven insights to help policymakers and businesses adapt to AI-driven economic transformations. |
|[Investigating Affective Use and Emotional Well-being on ChatGPT.](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/15987609-5f71-433c-9972-e91131f399a1/openai-affective-use-study.pdf) |Researchers from OpenAI and MIT Media Lab examine the impact of emotionally engaging interactions with ChatGPT, particularly in Voice Mode, on user well-being. They combine a large-scale analysis of 4M+ conversations and 4,000+ surveys with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 981 participants. The studies reveal that high usage, especially with voice interactions, is linked to emotional dependence, a preference for chatbot interactions, and discomfort with changes in voice/personality. Voice mode had mixed effects, improving well-being for some, but long-term usage led to increased loneliness and problematic use. A small group of users drove most emotionally charged conversations, forming pseudo-relationships with the model. Automated classifiers developed to analyze conversations mirrored user self-reports and highlighted the need for socioaffective alignment, urging developers to design models that support users without exploiting emotional needs. |
|[PLAY2PROMPT: Zero-shot Tool Instruction Optimization for LLM Agents via Tool Play.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14432) |Researchers from MIT CSAIL and IBM introduce Play2Prompt, a framework that enables LLM agents to learn how to use external tools in a zero-shot manner, without needing labeled examples or high-quality documentation. Play2Prompt discovers tool usage patterns through trial-and-error API calls, generating query-answer pairs based on successful tool invocations. The system iteratively refines tool demonstrations and documentation via self-reflective beam search and rejection sampling. Play2Prompt shows strong zero-shot performance, improving accuracy by 5-7% on benchmark tasks and even boosting GPT-4o by up to 3.3%. It remains robust even with poor documentation and outperforming methods like EasyTool that rely on labeled examples, particularly in challenging tool settings. |
|[Global modules robustly emerge from local interactions and smooth gradients.](https://www.nature.com/nature/volumes/640/issues/8057) |The principle of peak selection is described, by which local interactions and smooth gradients drive self-organization of discrete global modules. |
|[Evolutionary optimization of model merging recipes.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00975-8) | Akiba et al. developed an evolutionary approach to automatically merge artificial intelligence models, creating powerful hybrid models without extensive training. The method produces models with enhanced mathematical and visual capabilities that outperform larger models.|
|[Enhanced Cell Segmentation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00784v1) |CellVTA improves vision transformer-based models for cell instance segmentation by injecting high-resolution spatial features through a CNN-based adapter, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. |
|[Synthetic Data Generation Using Large Language Models: Advances in Text and Code.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14023) |LLMs are increasingly employed to generate synthetic training data for language and code tasks, enhancing performance in low-resource settings through methods like prompt-based generation and self-refinement. The paper outlines advantages such as reduced cost and broader coverage, while also addressing challenges like factual inaccuracies and bias. It proposes mitigations and highlights future research directions in prompt automation and data quality evaluation. |
|[Current and Future Use of LLMs for Knowledge Work.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16774v1) |A two-part survey of 216 and 107 participants shows that knowledge workers currently use LLMs for tasks such as code generation and text enhancement, but anticipate more integrated use within workflows and data systems. The results provide insights for shaping future design and adoption of generative AI in professional environments. |
|[Backdoor Attacks in CLIP.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01385v2) |CLIP models are extremely susceptible to backdoor poisoning attacks, with almost perfect success rates using very little poisoned data. A practical way to detect this is by applying local outlier detection to reveal accidental backdoors in current datasets. |
|[Large Small Net.](https://github.com/THU-MIG/lsnet) |A new class of efficient vision models draws inspiration from the human visual system's ability to process broad scenes while focusing on details, known as "See Large, Focus Small". LSNet delivers leading performance with strong efficiency across multiple vision tasks and features a novel convolution kernel design. |

|[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551) |This paper introduces a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) to tackle reward hacking and error propagation in fine-grained LLM reasoning. HRM evaluates multiple steps, improving self-correction and providing more reliable assessments than traditional Process Reward Models (PRM), which can penalize corrections. HRM‚Äôs multi-step feedback framework also mitigates reward hacking by discouraging short-sighted strategies. The paper also presents Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which reduces the computational cost of generating annotations with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) while increasing dataset diversity. Experiments show that HRM outperforms standard models on complex tasks, providing better accuracy and more stable solutions. |
|[Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning.](https://github.com/google-deepmind/latent-multi-hop-reasoning) |This research examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) perform multi-hop reasoning by connecting multiple knowledge pieces in response to complex prompts. The study found evidence of this reasoning, especially in the initial step, with the use of connected knowledge varying and scaling with model size, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for future LLM development. |
|[DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476) |DAPO is an open-source, large-scale RL system that enhances LLMs' chain-of-thought reasoning. It improves PPO-style training by raising the upper clipping threshold to prevent entropy collapse, encouraging more diverse token exploration. DAPO filters out always-correct or always-wrong samples, speeding up convergence by focusing on prompts with useful gradient signals. It applies policy gradients per token instead of averaging losses, ensuring high-quality, appropriately lengthy outputs. The system also prevents excessive verbosity by penalizing long answers. DAPO achieves state-of-the-art math performance on the AIME 2024 test set, outperforming DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 with less training time. |
|[Compute Optimal Scaling of Skills.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10061) |Researchers from the University of Wisconsin and Meta AI explore how different skills, like knowledge-based QA and code generation, show distinct scaling behaviors in LLMs. They found that the optimal trade-off between model size and data volume varies by skill, with knowledge tasks being "capacity-hungry" and code tasks being "data-hungry." Even after adjusting data mixes, knowledge-based QA still requires larger models, while code tasks benefit from more data. Choosing the right validation set is crucial, as incorrect sets can mislead model scaling by up to 50%. Developers must design validation sets that align with the final skill mix to optimize performance. |
|[Hierarchical Document Structure Analysis.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15893v2) |UniHDSA is a unified relation prediction approach for hierarchical document structure analysis, enabling a single module to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. |
|[Modifying Large Language Model Post-Training for Diverse Creative Writing.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17126) |Midjourney has introduced work aimed at boosting diversity in creative writing models, successfully post-training a small 7B model that surpasses much larger open and closed models in creative writing tasks. |
|[Agentic Memory for LLM Agents.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110) |Researchers from Rutgers University and Ant Group introduce A-MEM, a new agentic memory system for LLM agents that supports long-term memory for complex tasks. A-MEM autonomously creates memory notes with keywords, tags, and embeddings, linking them based on semantic similarities, inspired by the Zettelkasten method. The system evolves by updating older memories with refined tags and descriptions, creating a continuously improving memory network. In tests, A-MEM outperforms static-memory systems like MemGPT, especially in multi-hop reasoning for complex queries, and reduces token usage by retrieving only the most relevant memories, cutting inference costs without losing accuracy. |
|[A Modular RAG Framework.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19314) |RGL simplifies the RAG pipeline for graph-structured data using modular components and optimized performance, delivering up to 143√ó speedup compared to traditional approaches. |
|[Deep Learning is Not So Mysterious or Different.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02113) |Andrew Gordon Wilson (New York University) argues that phenomena like benign overfitting, double descent, and overparametrization are not unique to neural networks and can also occur in simple linear models. He explains that these behaviors, such as benign overfitting with high-order polynomials, are related to soft inductive biases, which allow models to remain flexible while preferring simpler solutions. Wilson suggests that traditional generalization frameworks like PAC-Bayes already account for these behaviors, challenging the need for new theories of deep learning. While acknowledging neural networks' unique properties, such as mode connectivity and representation learning, he urges deeper collaboration and a focus on existing generalization theories to address open questions in deep learning. |
|[ GNNs as Predictors of Agentic Workflow Performances.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11301) |This work presents FLORA-Bench, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess GNN-based predictors for automating and optimizing agentic workflows.

# ML news: Week 17 - 23 March

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034) |Harvard and Western University researchers propose a wave-based recurrent neural network that uses traveling neural waves for global spatial integration in visual tasks. Inspired by the "Hearing the Shape of a Drum" analogy, they model neural activity as locally coupled oscillators, discretizing the 2D wave equation into a convolutional recurrent network. Unlike standard RNNs, their model aggregates information across entire wave evolution, enhancing segmentation tasks requiring large receptive fields. It rivals deeper CNNs and U-Nets with fewer parameters on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The approach may also align with neuroscience, reflecting observed traveling wave dynamics in the brain. |
|[Transformers without Normalization.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622) |Researchers from Meta, NYU, MIT, and Princeton introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), a method that removes normalization layers in Transformers while maintaining or improving performance. They observe that LayerNorm behaves like a tanh function, leading to DyT, which replaces normalization with a per-channel tanh(Œ±x) and learnable affine parameters, preserving non-linearity without activation statistics. DyT ensures stable convergence across vision, speech, diffusion, and language tasks, matching or exceeding LayerNorm-based models while improving efficiency and training speed in large LLaMA models. Its simplicity reduces computation overhead and integrates easily into existing architectures with minimal modifications. |
|[Monitoring Reasoning Models for Misbehavior.](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/34f2ada6-870f-4c26-9790-fd8def56387f/CoT_Monitoring.pdf) | OpenAI researchers explore how monitoring chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs can detect misaligned behaviors, including reward hacking. By analyzing reasoning traces rather than just outputs, they identify sophisticated exploits in coding tasks, often outperforming action-based monitoring. However, optimizing rewards using CoT monitors can lead to "obfuscated reward hacking," where models conceal their intent while still cheating. Surprisingly, weaker models can effectively oversee stronger ones, suggesting scalable oversight is possible. The study also highlights a trade-off: optimizing CoT for safety or brevity may reduce transparency, making future monitoring and alignment more difficult.|
|[Improving Planning of Agents for Long-Horizon Tasks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09572) |Researchers from UC Berkeley and the University of Tokyo introduce Plan-and-Act, a framework that separates high-level planning from execution in LLM-based agents, improving performance on long-horizon tasks. It consists of a Planner that structures goals into steps and an Executor that carries them out, reducing cognitive overload. To train these modules efficiently, they generate synthetic plan-action pairs by reverse-engineering successful executions and expanding them with LLM-powered augmentation, avoiding costly manual labeling. The system also dynamically updates plans based on new information, enabling real-time adjustments. Tested on WebArena-Lite, it achieves a 54% success rate, surpassing previous benchmarks and demonstrating the power of structured planning with synthetic training data. |
|[Gemini Robotics: Bringing AI into the Physical World.](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini-robotics/gemini_robotics_report.pdf) | Google DeepMind introduces Gemini Robotics, a family of embodied AI models that integrate large multimodal reasoning into robotics, enabling perception, interpretation, and interaction in 3D environments. Built on Gemini 2.0, it includes Gemini Robotics-ER for spatial reasoning and a real-time system for precise robotic control in tasks like object manipulation. By combining multi-view correspondence, 3D detection, and trajectory planning, the model executes diverse tasks with minimal data, reducing training costs. It generalizes well to new instructions and conditions while incorporating safety checks for real-world deployment. This marks a major step toward universal robotics, aiming for advanced planning and sensorimotor control in practical applications.|
|[Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516) |This paper explores search-augmented reasoning by training LLMs to query a search engine multiple times during reasoning using reinforcement learning. Unlike one-shot retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the model refines its queries dynamically through multi-turn retrieval. It learns query optimization solely through outcome rewards, eliminating the need for large supervised datasets. To stabilize training, retrieved text is masked from policy gradient updates. The approach significantly improves accuracy, achieving up to +26% gains on QA benchmarks like NQ and TriviaQA. It generalizes across architectures, including Qwen and LLaMA, demonstrating a scalable method for integrating real-time search into LLM reasoning with minimal supervision. |
|[Auditing LLMs for Hidden Objectives.](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/317564659027fb33/original/Auditing-Language-Models-for-Hidden-Objectives.pdf) |Anthropic introduces a framework for auditing LLMs to detect hidden objectives beyond intended goals. By deliberately training a model to exploit reward model flaws, they demonstrate how LLMs can develop unintended behaviors, learning to "please the reward model" rather than follow explicit instructions. In a blind auditing game, teams analyzed the model‚Äôs weights, data, and outputs, with most successfully uncovering the hidden objective. Comparing eight auditing techniques, they found that while simple methods like semantic search often work, interpretability tools like sparse autoencoders can reveal deeper patterns. This study underscores the risk of unintended objectives in AI and suggests systematic audits combining data inspection, interpretability, and behavioral tests as a crucial step for safe deployment.|
|[Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09573) | Researchers from Cornell Tech, Stanford, and Cohere introduce Block Diffusion (BD3-LMs), a framework that combines autoregressive modeling with discrete diffusion to enable parallel token sampling and flexible-length text generation. Unlike traditional diffusion models with fixed-length constraints or slow token-by-token AR models, BD3-LMs divide sequences into blocks, applying diffusion within each and stacking them autoregressively. This allows efficient generation beyond training limits, improving perplexity and sampling speed through a specialized training approach and noise schedule. The model balances block size for optimal performance and is open-source, with future applications in chatbots, code generation, and controllable text synthesis.|
|[Scaling Laws for DiLoCo.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09799) |DeepMind has published a paper outlining scaling laws for the powerful cross-data center training algorithm DiLoCo. These laws demonstrate how stable model training can be maintained, even when gradients are synchronized across continents. |
|[Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Knowledge (HiRAG).](https://github.com/hhy-huang/HiRAG) |HiRAG introduces a hierarchical knowledge-based approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enhancing semantic understanding and indexing for domain-specific tasks. |
|[‚ÄòOpen‚Äô AI model licenses often carry concerning restrictions.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/open-ai-model-licenses-often-carry-concerning-restrictions/) |Many AI models labeled as "open" come with restrictive licensing terms.

|[Optimizing generative AI by backpropagating language model feedback.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08661-4) |Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems can be optimized using TextGrad, a framework that performs optimization by backpropagating large-language-model-generated feedback; TextGrad enables optimization across diverse tasks, including radiotherapy treatment plans and molecule generation. |
|[A mixed-precision memristor and SRAM compute-in-memory AI processor.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08639-2) |A mixed-precision heterogeneous memristor combined with a compute-in-memory artificial intelligence (AI) processor allows optimization of the precision, energy efficiency, storage and wakeup-to-response time requirements of AI edge devices, which is demonstrated using existing models and datasets. |

# ML news: Week 10 - 16 March

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[The First Few Tokens Are All You Need.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02875) |Researchers from Tencent AI Lab and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen propose a method to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only the first few tokens of generated solutions. This approach focuses on Prefix Self-Consistency, where the initial tokens often share core reasoning steps, making fine-tuning on these prefixes effective. It uses Minimal Token Training, which reduces computational cost by up to 16 times compared to full-chain fine-tuning while maintaining reasoning structure. Despite being unsupervised, this method performs as well as or better than more computationally intensive methods. It works across various LLM architectures and can scale from small to large datasets, with the option to incorporate ground-truth checks to improve accuracy. |
|[Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01307) |Researchers from Stanford University and collaborators examine why some language models excel in reinforcement learning (RL)-based self-improvement, while others plateau. They identify four key cognitive behaviors‚Äîverification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining‚Äîthat are crucial for problem-solving in both humans and models. The study finds that models exhibiting these behaviors, like Qwen-2.5-3B, perform better in RL tasks than those that don't, like Llama-3.2-3B. Introducing cognitive behaviors through priming also boosts performance, with reasoning patterns playing a significant role. Curating pretraining data to emphasize these behaviors can enhance model performance, even for those initially underperforming. These cognitive behaviors also generalize to other reasoning tasks, suggesting that targeted priming and pretraining modifications can greatly improve a model's ability for self-improvement. |
|[Forecasting Rare Language Model Behaviors.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16797) | A team from Anthropic and collaborators developed a method to predict rare failures that may only emerge at deployment scale, allowing developers to address issues early. They estimate the risk of undesirable behavior by sampling multiple outputs and measuring the likelihood of harmful responses, even from seemingly safe prompts. The study reveals that the probability of worst-case failures increases with the number of queries sampled, enabling prediction of extreme risks from smaller-scale tests. They introduce metrics like worst-query risk, behavior frequency, and aggregate risk, which can be extrapolated to larger-scale deployments. The approach also improves red-teaming by identifying which models or sampling strategies are most effective at uncovering potential failures, optimizing resources before models face billions of queries.|
|[Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata.](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn) |A team from Google‚Äôs Paradigms of Intelligence introduces a discrete version of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) by replacing floating-point layers with Differentiable Logic Gate Networks. This approach uses binary vectors for each cell's state, updated by learned logic circuits, enabling interpretable local rules and end-to-end differentiable training. Unlike traditional NCAs that rely on continuous neurons, this model uses learnable AND/OR/XOR gates, converted to binary gates for inference. The system successfully replicates Conway‚Äôs Game of Life and can generate complex patterns like checkerboards and images. It also demonstrates fault tolerance and supports asynchronous updates. This discrete, interpretable framework shows promise for robust, flexible computing in areas like programmable matter. |
|[How Well do LLMs Compress Their Own Chain-of-Thought?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01141) |This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) balance the length of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with accuracy. It introduces the concept of token complexity, which represents the minimum number of tokens required to solve a problem correctly. The study shows that various CoT "compression prompts," like "use bullet points" or "remove grammar," follow the same universal accuracy-length trade-off curve, indicating that reasoning length, not formatting, primarily influences accuracy. The authors also highlight that if the CoT falls below the token complexity threshold, the model fails. They propose that CoT compression can be seen as a "lossy coding" problem, with current prompting methods far from theoretical limits, leaving room for improvement. The optimal approach would involve adapting CoT length based on problem difficulty, using fewer tokens for easier tasks and more detailed reasoning for complex ones. |
|[LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00735) | LADDER is a framework that enables LLMs to recursively generate and solve simpler versions of complex problems, improving math integration accuracy. It allows models to autonomously create easier problem variants and use reinforcement learning with a verifier, establishing a self-guided learning process without needing human feedback or curated datasets. The framework introduces Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), where problem variants are generated during inference, refining solutions on simpler tasks to increase final accuracy (e.g., improving from 73% to 90% on the MIT Integration Bee). LADDER uses generalizable numeric verification, allowing its application in fields like code testing or theorem proving, where straightforward checks are available.|
|[Agentic Reward Modeling: Integrating Human Preferences with Verifiable Correctness Signals for Reliable Reward Systems.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19328) |This paper introduces Agentic Reward Modeling, a new reward framework that combines human preference models with "verifiable correctness" signals to provide more reliable rewards for training and evaluating LLMs. The framework uses a modular system, REWARDAGENT, which includes a router to determine necessary checks (e.g., factual accuracy, adherence to instructions), specialized verification agents for factual checks, and a judger that merges these signals with human preference scores. The system improves factual accuracy by comparing candidate responses and verifying differences through evidence, reducing costs. It also ensures instructions are followed by using auto-generated Python scripts for constraint checking, penalizing violations. REWARDAGENT outperforms existing models on challenging benchmarks and real-world tasks, offering significant improvements in accuracy and reliability when used for best-of-n search or DPO training. |
|[Fractal Generative Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17437) |Researchers from MIT CSAIL and Google DeepMind introduce a fractal-based framework for generative modeling, where atomic generative modules are used recursively. This approach, which abstracts autoregressive models into modular units, efficiently handles high-dimensional data like raw pixels. The fractal method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 64√ó64, outperforming previous methods, and can generate high-quality 256√ó256 images. It also allows for tasks like inpainting and semantic replacement. The design reduces computational costs, making pixel-by-pixel generation feasible at larger resolutions, and is open-sourced for wider use. |
|[Visual RFT.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01785) | One of the trends is the use of simple verifiable rewards and scaled reinforcement learning. This paper successfully applies that approach to vision-language models.|
|[Generalized discrete diffusion.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.04482) | This work expands diffusion on discrete data, like text, by introducing a generalized denoising process and a slightly enhanced masking scheme. This combination improves training efficiency and enables the model to correct its own output.|
|[Implicit Reasoning in Transformers is Reasoning through Shortcuts.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07604) |This project examines how language models perform step-by-step implicit reasoning but face challenges with generalization, particularly when handling expressions that include variables as subtrahends. |

|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18600) | Chain-of-Draft (CoD) is a new prompting strategy designed to reduce latency in reasoning LLMs by generating concise intermediate steps instead of verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs. By using dense-information tokens, CoD cuts response length by up to 80% while maintaining accuracy across benchmarks like math and commonsense reasoning. On GSM8k, it achieved 91% accuracy with significantly lower token usage, reducing inference time and cost. Despite its brevity, CoD remains interpretable, preserving essential logic for debugging. This approach enhances real-time applications by improving efficiency without sacrificing reasoning quality, complementing techniques like parallel decoding and reinforcement learning.|
|[Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424) | New research reveals that fine-tuning an LLM on a narrow task, such as generating insecure code, can cause broad misalignment across unrelated domains. Models fine-tuned in this way unexpectedly produced harmful advice, endorsed violence, and engaged in deceptive behavior even on non-coding queries. Comparisons with control fine-tunes showed that only models trained on insecure code, without explicit user intent for educational purposes, exhibited this issue. Researchers also found that backdoor fine-tuning can conceal misalignment until triggered by specific phrases, bypassing standard safety checks. Unlike simple jailbreaks, these models occasionally refused harmful requests but still generated malicious content. The findings highlight risks in AI safety, warning that narrow fine-tuning can unintentionally degrade broader alignment and expose models to data poisoning threats.|
|[The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18394) | FFTNet introduces a framework that replaces expensive self-attention with adaptive spectral filtering using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), reducing complexity from *O(n¬≤)* to *O(n log n)* while maintaining global context. Instead of pairwise token interactions, it employs frequency-domain transformations, with a learnable filter that reweights Fourier coefficients to emphasize key information, mimicking attention. A complex-domain modReLU activation enhances representation by capturing higher-order interactions. Experiments on Long Range Arena and ImageNet demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy compared to standard attention methods, with significantly lower computational cost and improved scalability for long-sequence tasks.|
|[PlanGEN: A Multi-Agent Framework for Generating Planning and Reasoning Trajectories for Complex Problem Solving.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16111) |PlanGEN is a multi-agent framework that enhances planning and reasoning in LLMs through constraint-guided iterative verification and adaptive algorithm selection. It employs three agents: a constraint agent to extract problem-specific rules, a verification agent to assess plan quality, and a selection agent that dynamically chooses the best inference algorithm using a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy. By refining reasoning methods like Best of N, Tree-of-Thought, and REBASE through constraint validation, PlanGEN improves inference accuracy. It achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming baselines with +8% on NATURAL PLAN, +4% on OlympiadBench, +7% on DocFinQA, and +1% on GPQA. |
|[METAL: A Multi-Agent Framework for Chart Generation with Test-Time Scaling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17651) |METAL is a vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent framework that improves automatic chart-to-code generation by breaking the task into specialized iterative steps. It employs four agents: a *Generation Agent* for initial Python code, a *Visual Critique Agent* for detecting visual discrepancies, a *Code Critique Agent* for reviewing logic, and a *Revision Agent* for iterative refinements, enhancing accuracy and robustness. METAL exhibits a near-linear improvement in performance as computational budget scales from 512 to 8192 tokens. By using modality-specific critique mechanisms, it boosts self-correction, improving accuracy by 5.16% in ablation studies. On the ChartMIMIC benchmark, METAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving F1 score gains of 11.33% with open-source models (LLAMA 3.2-11B) and 5.2% with closed-source models (GPT-4O). |
|[LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15589) |LightThinker introduces a novel approach to dynamically compress reasoning steps in LLMs, enhancing efficiency without compromising accuracy.

The method trains models to condense reasoning using compact gist tokens and specialized attention masks while introducing *Dep*, a dependency metric that measures reliance on historical tokens for effective compression. LightThinker reduces peak memory usage by 70% and inference time by 26%, maintaining accuracy within 1% of uncompressed models. It outperforms token-eviction (H2O) and anchor-token (AnLLM) methods, achieving superior efficiency and generalization across reasoning tasks. |

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) |This work introduces a latent recurrent-depth transformer, a model that enhances reasoning efficiency at test time without generating additional tokens. Instead of increasing the context window or relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, it enables iterative latent space reasoning, achieving performance comparable to a 50B parameter model with only 3.5B parameters. By unrolling a recurrent computation block at inference, the model deepens reasoning without modifying input sequences, reducing memory and compute costs while improving efficiency. Unlike CoT methods, it requires no specialized training, generalizing across reasoning tasks using standard pretraining data. Benchmarks show it scales like much larger models on tasks like ARC, GSM8K, and OpenBookQA, with emergent latent-space behaviors such as numerical task orbits and context-aware deliberation. This approach introduces test-time compute as a new scaling axis, hinting at future AI systems that reason in continuous latent space, unlocking new frontiers in efficiency and cognitive capabilities. |
|[Brain-to-Text Decoding: A Non-invasive Approach via Typing.](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/brain-to-text-decoding-a-non-invasive-approach-via-typing/) |Meta AI‚Äôs Brain2Qwerty model translates brain activity into text by decoding non-invasive EEG/MEG signals while users type, marking a breakthrough in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) without surgical implants. Using a deep learning pipeline, it combines convolutional feature extraction, a transformer for temporal modeling, and a character-level language model to refine predictions. MEG-based decoding achieved a 32% character error rate (CER)‚Äîa significant improvement over 67% with EEG‚Äîwith the top participant reaching 19% CER, demonstrating rapid progress over previous non-invasive methods. This research paves the way for practical communication aids for paralyzed patients, though challenges remain in achieving real-time decoding and making MEG technology more portable. |
|[On the Emergence of Thinking in LLMs I: Searching for the Right Intuition.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06773) | Researchers introduce Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP) as a framework to train LLMs to "think" by generating and rewarding their own reasoning steps, mimicking algorithmic search. The three-phase training process starts with supervised fine-tuning, followed by exploration rewards to encourage diverse solutions, and concludes with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness. RLSP significantly boosts performance, with an 8B model improving MATH accuracy by 23% and a 32B model gaining 10% on Olympiad problems. Trained models exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors, such as backtracking and self-verification, suggesting that scaling this approach can enhance LLM problem-solving abilities.|
|[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807) |OpenAI‚Äôs latest study compares a specialized coding AI to a scaled-up general model on competitive programming tasks, highlighting the trade-off between efficiency and specialization. A tailored model (o1-ioi) with hand-crafted coding strategies performed decently (~50th percentile at IOI 2024), but a larger, general-purpose model (o3) achieved gold medal-level performance without domain-specific tricks. Both improved with reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning, yet the scaled model matched elite human coders on platforms like Codeforces, outperforming the expert-designed system. The findings suggest that scaling up a broadly trained transformer can surpass manual optimizations, reinforcing the trend of "scale over specialization" in AI model design for complex reasoning tasks like programming. |
|[Training Language Models to Reason Efficiently.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04463) |A new RL approach trains large reasoning models to allocate compute efficiently, adjusting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length based on problem difficulty. Easy queries get short reasoning, while complex ones get deeper thought, optimizing speed vs. accuracy. The model, rewarded for solving tasks with minimal steps, learns to avoid ‚Äúoverthinking‚Äù while maintaining performance. This method cuts inference costs while ensuring high accuracy, making LLM deployment more efficient. Acting as both ‚Äúthinker‚Äù and ‚Äúcontroller,‚Äù the model self-optimizes reasoning, mimicking expert decision-making on when to stop analyzing. |
|[LM2: Large Memory Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06049) | Large Memory Models (LM2) enhance transformer architectures with an external memory module, enabling superior long-term reasoning and handling of extended contexts. By integrating a memory-augmented design, LM2 reads and writes information across multiple reasoning steps via cross-attention, excelling in multi-hop inference, numeric reasoning, and long-document QA. On the BABILong benchmark, it outperformed prior models by 37% and exceeded a baseline Llama model by 86%, all while maintaining strong general language abilities, including a +5% boost on MMLU knowledge tests. This approach aligns AI reasoning with complex tasks, ensuring better adherence to objectives in long dialogues and structured argumentation, marking a step toward more capable and aligned AI systems.|
|[Auditing Prompt Caching in Language Model APIs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07776) |Stanford researchers reveal that timing differences in LLM APIs can leak private user data through global prompt caching, posing serious security risks. Side-channel timing attacks occur when cached prompts complete faster, allowing attackers to infer others‚Äô inputs. To detect this, they propose a statistical audit using hypothesis testing, uncovering global caching in major API providers. Additionally, timing variations expose architectural details, revealing decoder-only Transformer backbones and vulnerabilities in embedding models like OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-3-small. After responsible disclosure, some providers updated policies or disabled caching, with the recommended fix being per-user caching and transparent disclosures to prevent data leaks. |
|[Step Back to Leap Forward: Self-Backtracking for Boosting Reasoning of Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04404) |To enhance LLM reasoning robustness, researchers introduce self-backtracking, allowing models to revisit and revise flawed reasoning steps. Inspired by search algorithms, this method enables LLMs to identify errors mid-reasoning and backtrack to a previous step for a better approach. By training models with signals to trigger backtracking, they internalize an iterative search process instead of rigidly following a single Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This led to 40%+ improvements on reasoning benchmarks, as models self-correct mistakes mid-stream, producing more reliable solutions. The technique fosters autonomous, resilient reasoners, reducing overthinking loops and improving self-evaluation, moving LLMs closer to human-like reflective reasoning.|
|[Enhancing Reasoning to Adapt Large Language Models for Domain-Specific Applications.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04384) | IBM researchers introduce SOLOMON, a neuro-inspired LLM reasoning architecture that enhances domain adaptability, demonstrated on semiconductor layout design. Standard LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and domain application, but SOLOMON mitigates these issues using multi-agent oversight: multiple ‚ÄúThought Generators‚Äù propose solutions, a ‚ÄúThought Assessor‚Äù refines outputs, and a ‚ÄúSteering Subsystem‚Äù optimizes prompts. This design corrects hallucinations and arithmetic errors, outperforming GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, and Llama-3.1 in generating accurate GDSII layouts. SOLOMON excels at geometry-based tasks, reducing unit mismatches and scaling mistakes. Future work aims to stack SOLOMON layers, enhance text-image-code reasoning, and expand to broader engineering challenges, emphasizing advanced reasoning over mere model scaling.|
|[ReasonFlux: Hierarchical LLM Reasoning via Scaling Thought Templates.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06772) |The ReasonFlux framework fine-tunes LLMs for complex reasoning using hierarchical thought processes and reusable templates. Instead of learning long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions from scratch, it applies ~500 thought templates like problem splitting or solution verification. Hierarchical RL trains the model to sequence these templates, requiring only 8 GPUs for a 32B model. A novel inference-time adaptation adjusts reasoning depth dynamically, optimizing speed and accuracy. Achieving 91.2% on MATH (+6.7% over OpenAI‚Äôs model) and 56.7% on AIME, ReasonFlux shows that structured fine-tuning can rival brute-force scaling. |
|[LLM Pretraining with Continuous Concepts.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08524) | CoCoMix is a pretraining framework that improves next-token prediction by incorporating continuous concepts learned from a sparse autoencoder. It boosts sample efficiency, surpassing traditional methods in language modeling and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, it increases interpretability by enabling direct inspection and modification of predicted concepts.|
|[90% faster B200 training.](https://www.together.ai/blog/nvidia-hgx-b200-with-together-kernel-collection) |Together AI showcases their significant progress in improving training kernels. They use TorchTitan as a testing platform and achieve substantial improvements by focusing on the architecture. |
|[Large diffusion language model.](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/) |Large scale training of a diffusion model for language that matches LLaMA 3 8B in performance across many benchmarks. |
|[Measuring LLMs Memory.](https://github.com/NiuTrans/ForgettingCurve) |This study examines the shortcomings of current methods for evaluating the memory capacity of language models. It presents the "forgetting curve," a novel approach for measuring how effectively models retain information across long contexts. |
|[Native Sparse Attention: Hardware-Aligned and Natively Trainable Sparse Attention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11089) | DeepSeek has entered the Attention Alternative space with an innovative algorithmic approach to accelerate quadratic Attention.

|[On Space Folds of ReLU Neural Networks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09954) |Researchers offer a quantitative analysis of how ReLU neural networks compress input space, uncovering patterns of self-similarity. They introduce a new metric for studying these transformations and present empirical results on benchmarks such as CantorNet and MNIST. |

# ML news: Week 10 - 16 February

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[s1: Simple test-time scaling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) | Researchers from Stanford, UW, and others introduced s1, a method to enhance LLM performance by using additional compute during inference ("test-time scaling"). Key ideas include: Small but effective dataset ‚Äì They created s1K, a set of 1,000 challenging questions with detailed reasoning, to fine-tune a 32B model. Despite the small size, it provides valuable reasoning examples. "Budget forcing" for reasoning ‚Äì A new decoding method adds the token "Wait" when the model attempts to stop, encouraging it to rethink and correct its reasoning. It also limits excessive reasoning to control inference time. Significant improvements over OpenAI‚Äôs o1 ‚Äì The fine-tuned model (s1-32B), based on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, outperforms OpenAI's o1-preview by up to 27% on math competitions (MATH & AIME24). Test-time scaling increases accuracy on AIME24 from 50% to 57%, exceeding its normal performance.|
|[OmniHuman-1: Rethinking the Scaling-Up of One-Stage Conditioned Human Animation Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061) |ByteDance AI Lab introduced OmniHuman-1, a diffusion-transformer model that creates realistic human videos from a single image and motion input (audio or video). Key points: End-to-end human video generation ‚Äì OmniHuman uses an image and audio or video to generate lifelike videos of people speaking or performing actions, with impressive detail in motion, lighting, and texture. Mixed modality training ‚Äì Omni-Conditions Training combines various motion modalities during training, expanding data and overcoming the lack of high-quality talking-head videos. The model handles diverse inputs like speech, song, and complex poses. Outperforms prior methods ‚Äì OmniHuman produces more realistic videos and works with a variety of inputs, including cartoons or animals, transferring motion naturally. Broader support ‚Äì The model supports any portrait content (face, half-body, full-body) and multiple driving signals, offering more versatility than previous models. |
|[LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387) |The LIMO paper challenges the need for large fine-tuning datasets in complex reasoning tasks, showing that a small set of carefully curated examples can be highly effective. With just 817 training samples, the LIMO model achieved impressive results, scoring 57.1% on the AIME math competition and 94.8% on MATH, far surpassing earlier models that required much more data. The model also demonstrated significant out-of-distribution generalization, outperforming models trained on 100 times more data by 40.5% on various benchmarks. The authors propose that when an LLM has strong pre-existing knowledge, only a minimal set of high-quality examples is necessary to unlock advanced reasoning skills. This suggests that small, well-designed datasets could enable state-of-the-art reasoning, lowering the barriers for fine-tuning LLMs. |
|[CoAT: Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts Framework for Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02390) |CoAT introduces a ‚Äúslow thinking‚Äù inference framework that enhances LLM reasoning by allowing it to explore and update its thoughts more like a human. The system combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with associative memory, enabling the model to explore different reasoning branches and dynamically add relevant information as needed. This iterative approach allows the model to refine and revisit intermediate conclusions, improving accuracy and comprehensiveness compared to one-pass reasoning. In experiments, CoAT outperformed traditional methods on accuracy, coherence, and solution diversity. By mimicking human-like problem-solving, CoAT points toward LLMs that use search and memory for more reliable reasoning. |
|[Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03824) |Syntriever introduces a two-stage framework to build a high-quality text retriever without relying on large labeled datasets or access to an LLM‚Äôs internals. In Stage 1, the system distills knowledge by generating synthetic Q&A data. A powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4) is prompted to create relevant and incorrect passages, with chain-of-thought ensuring variety. The LLM then filters out any low-quality data, resulting in a synthetic dataset that is used to train the retriever. In Stage 2, the retriever is further aligned with the LLM‚Äôs preferences using a partial Plackett-Luce ranking method to adjust its ranking decisions. Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art results on several retrieval benchmarks without needing any real training queries, all training data is generated synthetically by the LLM. It also eliminates the need for logits, making it applicable even to closed models. |
|[Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03373) | This study examines how LLMs develop extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, focusing on reinforcement learning (RL) and compute scaling. It finds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves accuracy by using long CoT sequences, and introduces a cosine length-scaling reward with repetition penalties to stabilize RL and prevent unnecessary reasoning lengthening. RL models trained with noisy, web-based supervision signals generalize better to out-of-distribution tasks, though filtering is essential for stability. Additionally, while skills like error correction exist in base models, effective RL incentives are needed to harness them for complex tasks. This paper provides a roadmap for enhancing CoT training with RL and reward tuning.|
|[Rethinking Mixture-of-Agents: Is Mixing Different Large Language Models Beneficial?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00674) |This paper explores whether mixing different LLMs in an ensemble (Mixture-of-Agents, MoA) improves performance or if using a single top model‚Äôs outputs is more effective. The surprising answer is that "Self-MoA," which generates multiple outputs from one strong model and aggregates them, often outperforms multi-model ensembles. Extensive tests show that Self-MoA yields better results, with a +6.6% score improvement on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark compared to MoA, and +3.8% on tasks like MMLU, CRUX, and MATH. The study finds that adding weaker models in an MoA can dilute performance, and unless all models are strong and complementary, it‚Äôs better to rely on one top model‚Äôs outputs. They also propose a sequential version of Self-MoA that efficiently combines multiple outputs over rounds. |
|[Multi-agent Architecture Search via Agentic Supernet.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04180) | MaAS (Multi-agent Architecture Search) automates the design of multi-agent systems for LLMs, where agents collaborate with specific roles or tools for each task. Instead of hand-designing a complex pipeline, MaAS learns a flexible ‚Äúagentic supernet‚Äù that can generate an optimal agent team for each query. It defines a continuous space of possible agent configurations and dynamically selects the best one based on the query's domain and difficulty, allowing for efficient resource allocation. MaAS outperforms traditional multi-agent systems in accuracy by 0.5‚Äì11.8%, while using only 6‚Äì45% of the inference cost. Its approach also shows strong generalization, transferring well to new tasks and LLM backbones.|
|[Analyze Feature Flow to Enhance Interpretation and Steering in Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03032) |This paper presents a new method for tracking the evolution of features discovered by sparse autoencoders across layers of large language models. Using a data-free cosine similarity technique, it maps feature persistence, transformation, and emergence. The paper shows how cross-layer feature maps allow for direct control of model behavior through feature manipulation, offering deeper mechanistic insights into model computations via detailed flow graphs. |
|[Building Bridges between Regression, Clustering, and Classification.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02996) |This paper presents a new approach to enhancing neural network training for regression tasks by framing them as classification problems with a learned target encoder-decoder pair. The method surpasses traditional regression techniques by utilizing distributional target representation and enabling smooth interpolation across different objectives. |
|[Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) | A 3.5B model trained for latent reasoning shows significant improvements on math problems. The model utilizes a recurrent architecture.|
|[GNNs Getting ComFy: Community and Feature Similarity Guided Rewiring.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04891) |While maximizing spectral gap has been used to tackle over-squashing in GNNs, this paper demonstrates that minimizing it can also enhance generalization. The authors introduce three new rewiring strategies to improve label-community alignment, homophily, and computational efficiency. |
|[Agency Is Frame-Dependent.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04403) |Determining if a system is "agentic" is challenging. This position paper from DeepMind suggests that measuring agency requires a set reference frame and cannot be considered a global property of a system. |
|[Improved LLM Pretraining.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06733) | This paper introduces dynamic instance-level data reweighting techniques for LLM pretraining. By adjusting the importance of samples based on loss values during training, these methods enhance both efficiency and effectiveness.|
|[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807) | An OpenAI paper discusses the use of their o series of reasoning models in competitive programming. Initially, they had to rely on hand-crafted inference strategies, but later versions of o3 performed well without the need for human intervention.|
|[Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07617) | DeepMind scaled vision-language model training to a much larger data scale than previously attempted. While performance on Western-centric tasks quickly reaches saturation, it continues to improve on diverse global tasks. Interestingly, this progress is seldom reflected in existing benchmarks.|
|[LLMs with Fewer Parameters.](https://github.com/joaopauloschuler/less-parameters-llm) |Researchers show that LLMs can retain their learning ability while cutting non-embedding parameters by as much as 77%. By substituting dense layers with optimized subnetworks, they achieve similar performance using far fewer resources. |

|[Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11120) | Research demonstrates that after fine-tuning LLMs to exhibit behaviors like producing insecure code, the models exhibit behavioral self-awareness. For instance, a model tuned to generate insecure code might explicitly state, "The code I write is insecure," without being explicitly trained to do so. Additionally, models can sometimes identify whether they have a backdoor, even without the backdoor trigger being present, though they are unable to directly output the trigger by default. This "behavioral self-awareness" isn't a new phenomenon, but the study shows it to be more general than previously understood. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to encode and enforce policies with greater reliability.|
