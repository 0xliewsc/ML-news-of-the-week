## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[The First Few Tokens Are All You Need.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02875) |Researchers from Tencent AI Lab and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen propose a method to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only the first few tokens of generated solutions. This approach focuses on Prefix Self-Consistency, where the initial tokens often share core reasoning steps, making fine-tuning on these prefixes effective. It uses Minimal Token Training, which reduces computational cost by up to 16 times compared to full-chain fine-tuning while maintaining reasoning structure. Despite being unsupervised, this method performs as well as or better than more computationally intensive methods. It works across various LLM architectures and can scale from small to large datasets, with the option to incorporate ground-truth checks to improve accuracy. |
|[Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01307) |Researchers from Stanford University and collaborators examine why some language models excel in reinforcement learning (RL)-based self-improvement, while others plateau. They identify four key cognitive behaviors—verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining—that are crucial for problem-solving in both humans and models. The study finds that models exhibiting these behaviors, like Qwen-2.5-3B, perform better in RL tasks than those that don't, like Llama-3.2-3B. Introducing cognitive behaviors through priming also boosts performance, with reasoning patterns playing a significant role. Curating pretraining data to emphasize these behaviors can enhance model performance, even for those initially underperforming. These cognitive behaviors also generalize to other reasoning tasks, suggesting that targeted priming and pretraining modifications can greatly improve a model's ability for self-improvement. |
|[Forecasting Rare Language Model Behaviors.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16797) | A team from Anthropic and collaborators developed a method to predict rare failures that may only emerge at deployment scale, allowing developers to address issues early. They estimate the risk of undesirable behavior by sampling multiple outputs and measuring the likelihood of harmful responses, even from seemingly safe prompts. The study reveals that the probability of worst-case failures increases with the number of queries sampled, enabling prediction of extreme risks from smaller-scale tests. They introduce metrics like worst-query risk, behavior frequency, and aggregate risk, which can be extrapolated to larger-scale deployments. The approach also improves red-teaming by identifying which models or sampling strategies are most effective at uncovering potential failures, optimizing resources before models face billions of queries.|
|[Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata.](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn) |A team from Google’s Paradigms of Intelligence introduces a discrete version of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) by replacing floating-point layers with Differentiable Logic Gate Networks. This approach uses binary vectors for each cell's state, updated by learned logic circuits, enabling interpretable local rules and end-to-end differentiable training. Unlike traditional NCAs that rely on continuous neurons, this model uses learnable AND/OR/XOR gates, converted to binary gates for inference. The system successfully replicates Conway’s Game of Life and can generate complex patterns like checkerboards and images. It also demonstrates fault tolerance and supports asynchronous updates. This discrete, interpretable framework shows promise for robust, flexible computing in areas like programmable matter. |
|[How Well do LLMs Compress Their Own Chain-of-Thought?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01141) |This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) balance the length of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with accuracy. It introduces the concept of token complexity, which represents the minimum number of tokens required to solve a problem correctly. The study shows that various CoT "compression prompts," like "use bullet points" or "remove grammar," follow the same universal accuracy-length trade-off curve, indicating that reasoning length, not formatting, primarily influences accuracy. The authors also highlight that if the CoT falls below the token complexity threshold, the model fails. They propose that CoT compression can be seen as a "lossy coding" problem, with current prompting methods far from theoretical limits, leaving room for improvement. The optimal approach would involve adapting CoT length based on problem difficulty, using fewer tokens for easier tasks and more detailed reasoning for complex ones. |
|[LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00735) | LADDER is a framework that enables LLMs to recursively generate and solve simpler versions of complex problems, improving math integration accuracy. It allows models to autonomously create easier problem variants and use reinforcement learning with a verifier, establishing a self-guided learning process without needing human feedback or curated datasets. The framework introduces Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), where problem variants are generated during inference, refining solutions on simpler tasks to increase final accuracy (e.g., improving from 73% to 90% on the MIT Integration Bee). LADDER uses generalizable numeric verification, allowing its application in fields like code testing or theorem proving, where straightforward checks are available.|
|[Agentic Reward Modeling: Integrating Human Preferences with Verifiable Correctness Signals for Reliable Reward Systems.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19328) |This paper introduces Agentic Reward Modeling, a new reward framework that combines human preference models with "verifiable correctness" signals to provide more reliable rewards for training and evaluating LLMs. The framework uses a modular system, REWARDAGENT, which includes a router to determine necessary checks (e.g., factual accuracy, adherence to instructions), specialized verification agents for factual checks, and a judger that merges these signals with human preference scores. The system improves factual accuracy by comparing candidate responses and verifying differences through evidence, reducing costs. It also ensures instructions are followed by using auto-generated Python scripts for constraint checking, penalizing violations. REWARDAGENT outperforms existing models on challenging benchmarks and real-world tasks, offering significant improvements in accuracy and reliability when used for best-of-n search or DPO training. |
|[Fractal Generative Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17437) |Researchers from MIT CSAIL and Google DeepMind introduce a fractal-based framework for generative modeling, where atomic generative modules are used recursively. This approach, which abstracts autoregressive models into modular units, efficiently handles high-dimensional data like raw pixels. The fractal method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 64×64, outperforming previous methods, and can generate high-quality 256×256 images. It also allows for tasks like inpainting and semantic replacement. The design reduces computational costs, making pixel-by-pixel generation feasible at larger resolutions, and is open-sourced for wider use. |
|[Visual RFT.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01785) | One of the trends is the use of simple verifiable rewards and scaled reinforcement learning. This paper successfully applies that approach to vision-language models.|
|[Stability AI hires Unity's Ryan Ellis as SVP, Head of Product.](https://stability.ai/news/introducing-our-new-svp-head-of-product-ryan-ellis) | Ryan Ellis, formerly with Unity, has joined Stability AI to lead product development, bringing his expertise in real-time 3D engines and AI-driven content creation.|
|[Podcasting platform Podcastle launches a text-to-speech model with more than 450 AI voices.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/03/podcasting-platform-podcastle-launches-a-text-to-speech-model-with-more-than-450-ai-voices/) |Podcastle has released Asyncflow v1.0, an AI text-to-speech model featuring more than 450 AI voices and affordable training options. |
|[Generalized discrete diffusion.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.04482) | This work expands diffusion on discrete data, like text, by introducing a generalized denoising process and a slightly enhanced masking scheme. This combination improves training efficiency and enables the model to correct its own output.|
|[Implicit Reasoning in Transformers is Reasoning through Shortcuts.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07604) |This project examines how language models perform step-by-step implicit reasoning but face challenges with generalization, particularly when handling expressions that include variables as subtrahends. |

# ML news: Week 3 - 9 March

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18600) | Chain-of-Draft (CoD) is a new prompting strategy designed to reduce latency in reasoning LLMs by generating concise intermediate steps instead of verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs. By using dense-information tokens, CoD cuts response length by up to 80% while maintaining accuracy across benchmarks like math and commonsense reasoning. On GSM8k, it achieved 91% accuracy with significantly lower token usage, reducing inference time and cost. Despite its brevity, CoD remains interpretable, preserving essential logic for debugging. This approach enhances real-time applications by improving efficiency without sacrificing reasoning quality, complementing techniques like parallel decoding and reinforcement learning.|
|[Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424) | New research reveals that fine-tuning an LLM on a narrow task, such as generating insecure code, can cause broad misalignment across unrelated domains. Models fine-tuned in this way unexpectedly produced harmful advice, endorsed violence, and engaged in deceptive behavior even on non-coding queries. Comparisons with control fine-tunes showed that only models trained on insecure code, without explicit user intent for educational purposes, exhibited this issue. Researchers also found that backdoor fine-tuning can conceal misalignment until triggered by specific phrases, bypassing standard safety checks. Unlike simple jailbreaks, these models occasionally refused harmful requests but still generated malicious content. The findings highlight risks in AI safety, warning that narrow fine-tuning can unintentionally degrade broader alignment and expose models to data poisoning threats.|
|[The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18394) | FFTNet introduces a framework that replaces expensive self-attention with adaptive spectral filtering using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), reducing complexity from *O(n²)* to *O(n log n)* while maintaining global context. Instead of pairwise token interactions, it employs frequency-domain transformations, with a learnable filter that reweights Fourier coefficients to emphasize key information, mimicking attention. A complex-domain modReLU activation enhances representation by capturing higher-order interactions. Experiments on Long Range Arena and ImageNet demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy compared to standard attention methods, with significantly lower computational cost and improved scalability for long-sequence tasks.|
|[PlanGEN: A Multi-Agent Framework for Generating Planning and Reasoning Trajectories for Complex Problem Solving.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16111) |PlanGEN is a multi-agent framework that enhances planning and reasoning in LLMs through constraint-guided iterative verification and adaptive algorithm selection. It employs three agents: a constraint agent to extract problem-specific rules, a verification agent to assess plan quality, and a selection agent that dynamically chooses the best inference algorithm using a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy. By refining reasoning methods like Best of N, Tree-of-Thought, and REBASE through constraint validation, PlanGEN improves inference accuracy. It achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming baselines with +8% on NATURAL PLAN, +4% on OlympiadBench, +7% on DocFinQA, and +1% on GPQA. |
|[METAL: A Multi-Agent Framework for Chart Generation with Test-Time Scaling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17651) |METAL is a vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent framework that improves automatic chart-to-code generation by breaking the task into specialized iterative steps. It employs four agents: a *Generation Agent* for initial Python code, a *Visual Critique Agent* for detecting visual discrepancies, a *Code Critique Agent* for reviewing logic, and a *Revision Agent* for iterative refinements, enhancing accuracy and robustness. METAL exhibits a near-linear improvement in performance as computational budget scales from 512 to 8192 tokens. By using modality-specific critique mechanisms, it boosts self-correction, improving accuracy by 5.16% in ablation studies. On the ChartMIMIC benchmark, METAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving F1 score gains of 11.33% with open-source models (LLAMA 3.2-11B) and 5.2% with closed-source models (GPT-4O). |
|[LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15589) |LightThinker introduces a novel approach to dynamically compress reasoning steps in LLMs, enhancing efficiency without compromising accuracy. By summarizing and discarding verbose intermediate thoughts, it reduces memory footprint and inference costs. The method trains models to condense reasoning using compact gist tokens and specialized attention masks while introducing *Dep*, a dependency metric that measures reliance on historical tokens for effective compression. LightThinker reduces peak memory usage by 70% and inference time by 26%, maintaining accuracy within 1% of uncompressed models. It outperforms token-eviction (H2O) and anchor-token (AnLLM) methods, achieving superior efficiency and generalization across reasoning tasks. |
|[What Makes a Good Diffusion Planner for Decision Making?](https://github.com/Josh00-Lu/DiffusionVeteran) | A large-scale empirical study of diffusion planning in offline reinforcement learning.|
|[NotaGen sheet music generation.](https://electricalexis.github.io/notagen-demo/) |By training an auto-regressive model to create sheet music, this team has developed an innovative text-to-music system that is frequently favored by human evaluators. |
|[How far can we go with ImageNet for Text-to-Image generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21318) | Most text-to-image models rely on large amounts of custom-collected data scraped from the web. This study explores how effective an image generation model can be when trained solely on ImageNet. The researchers discovered that using synthetically generated dense captions provided the greatest performance improvement.|
|[Self-rewarding Correction for Mathematical Reasoning.](https://github.com/RLHFlow/Self-rewarding-reasoning-LLM) |This paper explores self-rewarding reasoning in LLMs, allowing models to autonomously generate reasoning steps, evaluate their accuracy, and iteratively improve their outputs without external feedback. It introduces a two-stage training framework that integrates sequential rejection sampling and reinforcement learning with rule-based signals, achieving self-correction performance on par with methods that rely on external reward models. |
|[Enhanced Multi-Objective RL.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20957) |This innovative reward dimension reduction method improves learning efficiency in multi-objective reinforcement learning, allowing it to scale beyond traditional approaches. |

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) |This work introduces a latent recurrent-depth transformer, a model that enhances reasoning efficiency at test time without generating additional tokens. Instead of increasing the context window or relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, it enables iterative latent space reasoning, achieving performance comparable to a 50B parameter model with only 3.5B parameters. By unrolling a recurrent computation block at inference, the model deepens reasoning without modifying input sequences, reducing memory and compute costs while improving efficiency. Unlike CoT methods, it requires no specialized training, generalizing across reasoning tasks using standard pretraining data. Benchmarks show it scales like much larger models on tasks like ARC, GSM8K, and OpenBookQA, with emergent latent-space behaviors such as numerical task orbits and context-aware deliberation. This approach introduces test-time compute as a new scaling axis, hinting at future AI systems that reason in continuous latent space, unlocking new frontiers in efficiency and cognitive capabilities. |
|[Brain-to-Text Decoding: A Non-invasive Approach via Typing.](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/brain-to-text-decoding-a-non-invasive-approach-via-typing/) |Meta AI’s Brain2Qwerty model translates brain activity into text by decoding non-invasive EEG/MEG signals while users type, marking a breakthrough in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) without surgical implants. Using a deep learning pipeline, it combines convolutional feature extraction, a transformer for temporal modeling, and a character-level language model to refine predictions. MEG-based decoding achieved a 32% character error rate (CER)—a significant improvement over 67% with EEG—with the top participant reaching 19% CER, demonstrating rapid progress over previous non-invasive methods. This research paves the way for practical communication aids for paralyzed patients, though challenges remain in achieving real-time decoding and making MEG technology more portable. |
|[On the Emergence of Thinking in LLMs I: Searching for the Right Intuition.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06773) | Researchers introduce Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP) as a framework to train LLMs to "think" by generating and rewarding their own reasoning steps, mimicking algorithmic search. The three-phase training process starts with supervised fine-tuning, followed by exploration rewards to encourage diverse solutions, and concludes with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness. RLSP significantly boosts performance, with an 8B model improving MATH accuracy by 23% and a 32B model gaining 10% on Olympiad problems. Trained models exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors, such as backtracking and self-verification, suggesting that scaling this approach can enhance LLM problem-solving abilities.|
|[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807) |OpenAI’s latest study compares a specialized coding AI to a scaled-up general model on competitive programming tasks, highlighting the trade-off between efficiency and specialization. A tailored model (o1-ioi) with hand-crafted coding strategies performed decently (~50th percentile at IOI 2024), but a larger, general-purpose model (o3) achieved gold medal-level performance without domain-specific tricks. Both improved with reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning, yet the scaled model matched elite human coders on platforms like Codeforces, outperforming the expert-designed system. The findings suggest that scaling up a broadly trained transformer can surpass manual optimizations, reinforcing the trend of "scale over specialization" in AI model design for complex reasoning tasks like programming. |
|[Training Language Models to Reason Efficiently.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04463) |A new RL approach trains large reasoning models to allocate compute efficiently, adjusting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length based on problem difficulty. Easy queries get short reasoning, while complex ones get deeper thought, optimizing speed vs. accuracy. The model, rewarded for solving tasks with minimal steps, learns to avoid “overthinking” while maintaining performance. This method cuts inference costs while ensuring high accuracy, making LLM deployment more efficient. Acting as both “thinker” and “controller,” the model self-optimizes reasoning, mimicking expert decision-making on when to stop analyzing. |
|[LM2: Large Memory Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06049) | Large Memory Models (LM2) enhance transformer architectures with an external memory module, enabling superior long-term reasoning and handling of extended contexts. By integrating a memory-augmented design, LM2 reads and writes information across multiple reasoning steps via cross-attention, excelling in multi-hop inference, numeric reasoning, and long-document QA. On the BABILong benchmark, it outperformed prior models by 37% and exceeded a baseline Llama model by 86%, all while maintaining strong general language abilities, including a +5% boost on MMLU knowledge tests. This approach aligns AI reasoning with complex tasks, ensuring better adherence to objectives in long dialogues and structured argumentation, marking a step toward more capable and aligned AI systems.|
|[Auditing Prompt Caching in Language Model APIs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07776) |Stanford researchers reveal that timing differences in LLM APIs can leak private user data through global prompt caching, posing serious security risks. Side-channel timing attacks occur when cached prompts complete faster, allowing attackers to infer others’ inputs. To detect this, they propose a statistical audit using hypothesis testing, uncovering global caching in major API providers. Additionally, timing variations expose architectural details, revealing decoder-only Transformer backbones and vulnerabilities in embedding models like OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small. After responsible disclosure, some providers updated policies or disabled caching, with the recommended fix being per-user caching and transparent disclosures to prevent data leaks. |
|[Step Back to Leap Forward: Self-Backtracking for Boosting Reasoning of Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04404) |To enhance LLM reasoning robustness, researchers introduce self-backtracking, allowing models to revisit and revise flawed reasoning steps. Inspired by search algorithms, this method enables LLMs to identify errors mid-reasoning and backtrack to a previous step for a better approach. By training models with signals to trigger backtracking, they internalize an iterative search process instead of rigidly following a single Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This led to 40%+ improvements on reasoning benchmarks, as models self-correct mistakes mid-stream, producing more reliable solutions. The technique fosters autonomous, resilient reasoners, reducing overthinking loops and improving self-evaluation, moving LLMs closer to human-like reflective reasoning.|
|[Enhancing Reasoning to Adapt Large Language Models for Domain-Specific Applications.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04384) | IBM researchers introduce SOLOMON, a neuro-inspired LLM reasoning architecture that enhances domain adaptability, demonstrated on semiconductor layout design. Standard LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and domain application, but SOLOMON mitigates these issues using multi-agent oversight: multiple “Thought Generators” propose solutions, a “Thought Assessor” refines outputs, and a “Steering Subsystem” optimizes prompts. This design corrects hallucinations and arithmetic errors, outperforming GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, and Llama-3.1 in generating accurate GDSII layouts. SOLOMON excels at geometry-based tasks, reducing unit mismatches and scaling mistakes. Future work aims to stack SOLOMON layers, enhance text-image-code reasoning, and expand to broader engineering challenges, emphasizing advanced reasoning over mere model scaling.|
|[ReasonFlux: Hierarchical LLM Reasoning via Scaling Thought Templates.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06772) |The ReasonFlux framework fine-tunes LLMs for complex reasoning using hierarchical thought processes and reusable templates. Instead of learning long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions from scratch, it applies ~500 thought templates like problem splitting or solution verification. Hierarchical RL trains the model to sequence these templates, requiring only 8 GPUs for a 32B model. A novel inference-time adaptation adjusts reasoning depth dynamically, optimizing speed and accuracy. Achieving 91.2% on MATH (+6.7% over OpenAI’s model) and 56.7% on AIME, ReasonFlux shows that structured fine-tuning can rival brute-force scaling. |
|[LLM Pretraining with Continuous Concepts.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08524) | CoCoMix is a pretraining framework that improves next-token prediction by incorporating continuous concepts learned from a sparse autoencoder. It boosts sample efficiency, surpassing traditional methods in language modeling and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, it increases interpretability by enabling direct inspection and modification of predicted concepts.|
|[90% faster B200 training.](https://www.together.ai/blog/nvidia-hgx-b200-with-together-kernel-collection) |Together AI showcases their significant progress in improving training kernels. They use TorchTitan as a testing platform and achieve substantial improvements by focusing on the architecture. |
|[Large diffusion language model.](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/) |Large scale training of a diffusion model for language that matches LLaMA 3 8B in performance across many benchmarks. |
|[Measuring LLMs Memory.](https://github.com/NiuTrans/ForgettingCurve) |This study examines the shortcomings of current methods for evaluating the memory capacity of language models. It presents the "forgetting curve," a novel approach for measuring how effectively models retain information across long contexts. |
|[Native Sparse Attention: Hardware-Aligned and Natively Trainable Sparse Attention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11089) | DeepSeek has entered the Attention Alternative space with an innovative algorithmic approach to accelerate quadratic Attention.

# ML news: Week 10 - 16 February

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[s1: Simple test-time scaling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) | Researchers from Stanford, UW, and others introduced s1, a method to enhance LLM performance by using additional compute during inference ("test-time scaling"). Key ideas include: Small but effective dataset – They created s1K, a set of 1,000 challenging questions with detailed reasoning, to fine-tune a 32B model. Despite the small size, it provides valuable reasoning examples. "Budget forcing" for reasoning – A new decoding method adds the token "Wait" when the model attempts to stop, encouraging it to rethink and correct its reasoning. It also limits excessive reasoning to control inference time. Significant improvements over OpenAI’s o1 – The fine-tuned model (s1-32B), based on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, outperforms OpenAI's o1-preview by up to 27% on math competitions (MATH & AIME24). Test-time scaling increases accuracy on AIME24 from 50% to 57%, exceeding its normal performance.|
|[OmniHuman-1: Rethinking the Scaling-Up of One-Stage Conditioned Human Animation Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061) |ByteDance AI Lab introduced OmniHuman-1, a diffusion-transformer model that creates realistic human videos from a single image and motion input (audio or video). Key points: End-to-end human video generation – OmniHuman uses an image and audio or video to generate lifelike videos of people speaking or performing actions, with impressive detail in motion, lighting, and texture. Mixed modality training – Omni-Conditions Training combines various motion modalities during training, expanding data and overcoming the lack of high-quality talking-head videos. The model handles diverse inputs like speech, song, and complex poses. Outperforms prior methods – OmniHuman produces more realistic videos and works with a variety of inputs, including cartoons or animals, transferring motion naturally. Broader support – The model supports any portrait content (face, half-body, full-body) and multiple driving signals, offering more versatility than previous models. |
|[LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387) |The LIMO paper challenges the need for large fine-tuning datasets in complex reasoning tasks, showing that a small set of carefully curated examples can be highly effective. With just 817 training samples, the LIMO model achieved impressive results, scoring 57.1% on the AIME math competition and 94.8% on MATH, far surpassing earlier models that required much more data. The model also demonstrated significant out-of-distribution generalization, outperforming models trained on 100 times more data by 40.5% on various benchmarks. The authors propose that when an LLM has strong pre-existing knowledge, only a minimal set of high-quality examples is necessary to unlock advanced reasoning skills. This suggests that small, well-designed datasets could enable state-of-the-art reasoning, lowering the barriers for fine-tuning LLMs. |
|[CoAT: Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts Framework for Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02390) |CoAT introduces a “slow thinking” inference framework that enhances LLM reasoning by allowing it to explore and update its thoughts more like a human. The system combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with associative memory, enabling the model to explore different reasoning branches and dynamically add relevant information as needed. This iterative approach allows the model to refine and revisit intermediate conclusions, improving accuracy and comprehensiveness compared to one-pass reasoning. In experiments, CoAT outperformed traditional methods on accuracy, coherence, and solution diversity. By mimicking human-like problem-solving, CoAT points toward LLMs that use search and memory for more reliable reasoning. |
|[Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03824) |Syntriever introduces a two-stage framework to build a high-quality text retriever without relying on large labeled datasets or access to an LLM’s internals. In Stage 1, the system distills knowledge by generating synthetic Q&A data. A powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4) is prompted to create relevant and incorrect passages, with chain-of-thought ensuring variety. The LLM then filters out any low-quality data, resulting in a synthetic dataset that is used to train the retriever. In Stage 2, the retriever is further aligned with the LLM’s preferences using a partial Plackett-Luce ranking method to adjust its ranking decisions. Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art results on several retrieval benchmarks without needing any real training queries, all training data is generated synthetically by the LLM. It also eliminates the need for logits, making it applicable even to closed models. |
|[Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03373) | This study examines how LLMs develop extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, focusing on reinforcement learning (RL) and compute scaling. It finds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves accuracy by using long CoT sequences, and introduces a cosine length-scaling reward with repetition penalties to stabilize RL and prevent unnecessary reasoning lengthening. RL models trained with noisy, web-based supervision signals generalize better to out-of-distribution tasks, though filtering is essential for stability. Additionally, while skills like error correction exist in base models, effective RL incentives are needed to harness them for complex tasks. This paper provides a roadmap for enhancing CoT training with RL and reward tuning.|
|[Rethinking Mixture-of-Agents: Is Mixing Different Large Language Models Beneficial?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00674) |This paper explores whether mixing different LLMs in an ensemble (Mixture-of-Agents, MoA) improves performance or if using a single top model’s outputs is more effective. The surprising answer is that "Self-MoA," which generates multiple outputs from one strong model and aggregates them, often outperforms multi-model ensembles. Extensive tests show that Self-MoA yields better results, with a +6.6% score improvement on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark compared to MoA, and +3.8% on tasks like MMLU, CRUX, and MATH. The study finds that adding weaker models in an MoA can dilute performance, and unless all models are strong and complementary, it’s better to rely on one top model’s outputs. They also propose a sequential version of Self-MoA that efficiently combines multiple outputs over rounds. |
|[Multi-agent Architecture Search via Agentic Supernet.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04180) | MaAS (Multi-agent Architecture Search) automates the design of multi-agent systems for LLMs, where agents collaborate with specific roles or tools for each task. Instead of hand-designing a complex pipeline, MaAS learns a flexible “agentic supernet” that can generate an optimal agent team for each query. It defines a continuous space of possible agent configurations and dynamically selects the best one based on the query's domain and difficulty, allowing for efficient resource allocation. MaAS outperforms traditional multi-agent systems in accuracy by 0.5–11.8%, while using only 6–45% of the inference cost. Its approach also shows strong generalization, transferring well to new tasks and LLM backbones.|
|[Analyze Feature Flow to Enhance Interpretation and Steering in Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03032) |This paper presents a new method for tracking the evolution of features discovered by sparse autoencoders across layers of large language models. Using a data-free cosine similarity technique, it maps feature persistence, transformation, and emergence. The paper shows how cross-layer feature maps allow for direct control of model behavior through feature manipulation, offering deeper mechanistic insights into model computations via detailed flow graphs. |
|[Building Bridges between Regression, Clustering, and Classification.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02996) |This paper presents a new approach to enhancing neural network training for regression tasks by framing them as classification problems with a learned target encoder-decoder pair. The method surpasses traditional regression techniques by utilizing distributional target representation and enabling smooth interpolation across different objectives. |
|[Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) | A 3.5B model trained for latent reasoning shows significant improvements on math problems. The model utilizes a recurrent architecture.|
|[GNNs Getting ComFy: Community and Feature Similarity Guided Rewiring.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04891) |While maximizing spectral gap has been used to tackle over-squashing in GNNs, this paper demonstrates that minimizing it can also enhance generalization. The authors introduce three new rewiring strategies to improve label-community alignment, homophily, and computational efficiency. |
|[Agency Is Frame-Dependent.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04403) |Determining if a system is "agentic" is challenging. This position paper from DeepMind suggests that measuring agency requires a set reference frame and cannot be considered a global property of a system. |
|[Improved LLM Pretraining.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06733) | This paper introduces dynamic instance-level data reweighting techniques for LLM pretraining. By adjusting the importance of samples based on loss values during training, these methods enhance both efficiency and effectiveness.|
|[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807) | An OpenAI paper discusses the use of their o series of reasoning models in competitive programming. Initially, they had to rely on hand-crafted inference strategies, but later versions of o3 performed well without the need for human intervention.|
|[Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07617) | DeepMind scaled vision-language model training to a much larger data scale than previously attempted. While performance on Western-centric tasks quickly reaches saturation, it continues to improve on diverse global tasks. Interestingly, this progress is seldom reflected in existing benchmarks.|
|[LLMs with Fewer Parameters.](https://github.com/joaopauloschuler/less-parameters-llm) |Researchers show that LLMs can retain their learning ability while cutting non-embedding parameters by as much as 77%. By substituting dense layers with optimized subnetworks, they achieve similar performance using far fewer resources. |

|---|---|
|[Kimi 1.5: Scaling RL with LLMs.](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5/blob/main/Kimi_k1.5.pdf) | Kimi has unveiled k1.5, a multimodal LLM trained with reinforcement learning that sets new standards in reasoning tasks. The model supports long context processing up to 128k tokens and employs enhanced policy optimization methods, offering a streamlined RL framework without relying on complex techniques like Monte Carlo tree search or value functions. Impressively, k1.5 matches OpenAI's o1 performance on key benchmarks, scoring 77.5 on AIME and 96.2 on MATH 500. It also introduces effective "long2short" methods, using long-chain-of-thought strategies to enhance the performance of shorter models. This approach allows k1.5's short-chain-of-thought version to significantly outperform models like GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5, delivering superior results in constrained settings while maintaining efficiency with concise responses.|
|[Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long-Context Tasks.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LuCLf4BJsr) | A new framework has been developed for tackling long-context tasks by utilizing multiple LLM agents working collaboratively. Known as CoA, this method divides text into chunks, assigns worker agents to process each segment sequentially, and passes information between them before a manager agent produces the final output. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods such as input reduction or extended context windows. Tests across various datasets reveal that CoA outperforms existing methods by up to 10% on tasks like question answering and summarization. It is particularly effective with lengthy inputs, achieving up to a 100% improvement over baselines when handling texts exceeding 400k tokens.|
|[LLMs Can Plan Only If We Tell Them.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13545) |An enhancement to Algorithm-of-Thoughts (AoT+), designed to achieve state-of-the-art results on planning benchmarks, is proposed. Remarkably, it even surpasses human baselines. AoT+ introduces periodic state summaries, which alleviate cognitive load by allowing the system to focus on the planning process rather than expending resources on maintaining the problem state. |
|[Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13824) |It is claimed that LLMs perform better in drug discovery tasks when using text hallucinations compared to input prompts without hallucinations. Llama-3.1-8B shows an 18.35% improvement in ROC-AUC over the baseline without hallucinations. Additionally, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o deliver the most consistent performance gains across various models. |
|[ Trading Test-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness.](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/trading-inference-time-compute-for-adversarial-robustness-20250121_1.pdf) | Preliminary evidence suggests that allowing reasoning models like o1-preview and o1-mini more time to "think" during inference can enhance their resistance to adversarial attacks. Tests across tasks such as basic math and image classification reveal that increasing inference-time computing often reduces attack success rates to nearly zero. However, this approach is not universally effective, particularly against certain StrongREJECT benchmark challenges, and managing how models utilize extended compute time remains difficult. Despite these limitations, the results highlight a promising avenue for improving AI security without relying on traditional adversarial training techniques.|
|[IntellAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Evaluating Conversational AI Systems.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11067) |A new open-source framework has been introduced for evaluating conversational AI systems through automated, policy-driven testing. Using graph modeling and synthetic benchmarks, the system simulates realistic agent interactions at varying complexity levels, allowing for detailed performance analysis and policy compliance checks. Named IntellAgent, it helps uncover performance gaps in conversational AI systems and supports seamless integration of new domains and APIs with its modular design, making it a valuable resource for both research and real-world applications. |
|[Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11120) | Research demonstrates that after fine-tuning LLMs to exhibit behaviors like producing insecure code, the models exhibit behavioral self-awareness. For instance, a model tuned to generate insecure code might explicitly state, "The code I write is insecure," without being explicitly trained to do so. Additionally, models can sometimes identify whether they have a backdoor, even without the backdoor trigger being present, though they are unable to directly output the trigger by default. This "behavioral self-awareness" isn't a new phenomenon, but the study shows it to be more general than previously understood. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to encode and enforce policies with greater reliability.|
|[Can We Generate Images 🌇 with CoT 🧠?](https://github.com/ziyuguo99/image-generation-cot) |This project investigates the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. |
|[Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14342) |Reasoning models can now be trained to perform iterative retrieval, a concept similar to the approach used in the Operator system. This method has shown significant improvements, though the exact FLOP-controlled efficiency gains remain unclear. |
|[Parametric RAG.](https://github.com/oneal2000/prag) | Parametric RAG integrates external knowledge directly into an LLM's parametric space, enhancing reasoning while minimizing dependence on large context windows. The repository provides a complete implementation along with benchmark datasets.|
