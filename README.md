|[De novo design of high-affinity protein binderswith AlphaProteo.](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/AlphaProteo2024.pdf) |demonstrates a family of machine learning models that have been trained for protein design; reports 3-to 300-fold improvements in binding affinities and higher experimental success rates when compared to other methods on seven target proteins; demonstrates that AlphaProteo's performance is similar to the seven targets when tested on hundreds of target proteins from the PDB.  |
|[In Defense of RAG in the Era of Long-Context Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01666) |reports that one of the main problems that a RAG system addresses (i.e., uses more relevant information) is that longer-context LLMs suffer from a diminished focus on relevant information. They suggest an order-preserving RAG mechanism that enhances performance on long-context question answering, but it's not perfect—in fact, the quality of responses increases and then declines as retrieved chunks increase. They also mention a sweet spot where it can achieve better quality with a lot fewer tokens than long-context LLMs. |
|[Strategic Chain-of-Thought: Guiding Accurate Reasoning in LLMs through Strategy Elicitation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03271v1) | a technique to improve LLM performance by adding strategic information before the intermediate CoT reasoning phases; the strategy for addressing problems aids in directing the creation of the CoT paths and solutions; promises to use the Llama3-8b model to get a 21.05% gain on the GSM8K datasets.|

This approach, known as meta-rewarding LLMs, proposes a self-improving alignment technique (no human supervision) where the LLM judges its judgments and uses the feedback to improve its judgment skills.|
|[MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20183) | In MindSearch, a multi-agent framework based on LLM is presented for complex web-information seeking and integration tasks. A web planner is utilized to efficiently break down complex queries, while a web searcher performs hierarchical information retrieval on the Internet to enhance the relevance of the retrieved information. An iterative graph construction is employed in the planning component to better model complex problem-solving processes. The multi-agent framework is better suited for handling long context problems by assigning retrieval and reasoning tasks to specialized agents.|
|[Improving Retrieval Augmented Language Model with Self-Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19813) |Enhanced RAG through Self-Reasoning - utilizes the reasoning trajectories produced by the LLM itself to offer an end-to-end self-reasoning framework that enhances the dependability and traceability of RAG systems. The LLM is utilized to do the following three procedures: This method helps the model be more selective, reason and distinguish relevant and irrelevant documents, thus improving the accuracy of the RAG system as a whole. 1) Relevance-aware: evaluates the relevance between the retrieved documents and the question; 2) Evidence-aware selective: selects and cites relevant documents, and then automatically selects key sentence snippets as evidence from the cited documents; and 3) Trajectory analysis: generates a concise analysis based on all gathered self-reasoning trajectories generated by the preceding 2 processes, and then provides the final inferred answer. Using only 2,000 training examples, the framework outperforms GPT-4. (produced by GPT-4) |
|[Concise Thoughts: Impact of Output Length on LLM Reasoning and Cost.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19825) |Constrained-CoT, a model that restricts the reasoning output length without compromising performance, demonstrates that increasing the LLaMA2-70b's reasoning limit to 100 words increases accuracy on GSM8K from 36.01% (CoT) to 41.07% (CCoT) while lowering the average output length by 28 words. |
|[ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21018) | ThinK  focuses on long-context scenarios and inference; it offers a query-dependent KV cache pruning method to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least important channels.

|---|---|
|[AI existential risk probabilities are too unreliable to inform policy.](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-existential-risk-probabilities) |The use of AI existential risk probability estimates for policymaking is criticized in this essay, which contends that these estimates are excessively erratic and lack a strong inductive or deductive foundation, frequently approximating educated guesses rather than fact-based projections. The authors argue against the validity of using these projections to inform public policy, particularly when they are connected to expensive or restricting measures, and they support an evidence-based strategy that takes AI development uncertainty into account. They advise against utilizing speculative existential risk probability in high-impact decisions and instead suggest concentrating on specified AI milestones for more significant policy choices. |
